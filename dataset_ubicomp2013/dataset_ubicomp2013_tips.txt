2374	390	Mac and cheese: Decent. Not awesome, but worth having.
20537	390	Cheese grits = amazing. Order a bloody Mary with whatever your breakfast pick is, add bacon & jalepenos

50489	390	Definitely was good enough to eat, but I am not sure it warrants the lengthy wait.  The tuna melt was certainly one of the best in New York and the hot apple cider is nice. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

62734	423	JG Melon for nightcap with burger and jukebox

11372	446	Best lobster roll in NYC. Whole bronzini is the 2nd best dish. Sundae's are amazing too.
22056	446	Sardine special was great. Lobster roll too. Deep fried oysters and clams were only OK. Sliders were fine, not overwhelmingly great, but not bad.
62068	446	Lovely brunch gazpacho!
107530	446	I'd vote for the fish taco's as well. The lobster roll is very good, but too mayonnaisey for my wife.  And the lobster knuckles are fun and tasty if you are skilled at removal.
11372	446	HarryH is right, best lobster roll in the city but the star is the whole grilled daily fish. I prefer the bronzini!
54073	446	MFC is a weekly staple. Grilled whole fish, fish tacos, cockles, lobster knuckles...all good!

53109	452	Amazing brunch.  Delicious Latin American dishes and all you can drink Sangria.
28196	452	Favorite Upper West Side Drunch Spot. Cheap & the sangria keeps flowing throughout the duration of your meal. The food and portions aren't the greatest but cocktails make up for it.
175941	452	Try the earthy tasting Spanish Harlem sangria on a cold night. Yum!
196154	452	definitely worth the trip uptown.  Awesome brunch!

25218	504	Strongest Margaritas going, and usually have a $5 margarita special all day Sunday.
152611	507	Prices are steep, but its NYC so its average. Prime NY Strip Steak ($48) was excellent. Seems like I can only get good steak in NY.
58063	507	And MAJOR waiter fail. No spoon for my friend having soup and no steak knife for me having steak.
58063	507	The change in chefs is unfortunate and the service was the slowest ever. Another table left before getting food because it was taking so long.
120838	512	Skip the avocado rolls- they're weird.  Get the huge margarita- they're awesome!
60601	512	The margaritas are basic, but will do the job (and surprisingly I didn't have a hangover the next day). Plenty of vegan options and the food tastes fresh and un-heavy. YUMM!!

29638	514	A little bit of a wait, so try to make a reservation. Burger was big but overpriced. Brunch looked phenomenal.
105569	514	I expected their takeaway to be cheaper than dine in... was not the case
7366	518	Must order one of their specialty Bloody Mary's
196154	518	The best brunch ever!  Be prepared to wait for a table!

29594	543	This is my Monday night choice!  The sushi is good; esp when you consider that is is half price!  I like the mango choices.  Also, the Rolls Royce martini is a homerun one stop doozy.
29594	543	I was so excited 2 get my free drink upon my 3rd visit that I dragged my pal here, only to have the server assume that I would not want the full service associated w\/ the Rolls Royce drink. How rude!

6243	545	Takoyaki- what else?  Get the combo A with squid Okonomiyaki.

72170	549	The seared tuna salad (a special) is really tasty and light.
10932	549	Wow! A surprisingly delicious burger!
14964	549	Bar Tabac has live music evenings Sunday-Thursday -- I guess on the weekends they want that extra bar space for paying customers.Typical music seems to be old-timey toe-tapping jazz, and I think it
60601	549	I love love the goat cheese salad. This place is always fresh and delicious.
2367	549	Try the mussels. Amazing!

107110	561	Great frozen margaritas!
31903	561	Quality not as good under the new owners.  Used to be special, now a little ordinary.  Empty tables on a Saturday night...

19335	564	Any drink with passion fruit won't let you down.

96156	571	The food it's always good, and they have a pretty decent bar. Servers are always nice, but always seem to be eithet flakey or slow.
75708	571	So if you order a burger and don't get a beer on Monday, they charge you the full price. I don't drink. So I said no beer. Next time I'll just waste the beer. Clowns.
54289	571	Get the jerk chix soft shell tacos. Sooo good! The coconut crusted catfish strips & dipping sauce is pretty good too.

215619	578	Great spot to bring visitors from Pacific NW, kinda hectic & snobby for a brew house pub.

17394	578	Word to the wise: You can't fill a growler here anymore.
17394	578	Not the best brewery tour...Maybe best during the week...
211609	578	K: The Brewery had a great vibe! I felt like I was at a backyard party and everyone from the neighborhood was there. The beers were really stellar.

116062	603	The avgolemono soup is just delicious! Better than my ma's and grans.
30502	603	A great place to meet celebrities,  cewebrites, or both, like Vin Vacanti.

1002	608	try the bar, great place to eat if you have not planned ahead
126441	609	Go to Lombardi's for the pepperoni, sausage and extra mozzarella pizza. So so good! And skip the breadsticks...
172909	609	Do not order the breadsticks here, its a waste of money, its an inflated dry pizza crust, lacks butter and italian seasoning. Pizza Hut has better breadsticks!

219614	609	Try the old classic Homemade Meatballs pizza!
14141	609	Try the Pepperoni Pie - Is it as good as Gremaldi's? The jury's still out. (via @Foodspotting)
14964	609	P.S. If you have any room left after pizza, top it off with dessert at Rice to Riches across the street. It's like an ice cream parlor but with rice pudding. Really.
14964	609	My favorite vegetarian pie: kalamata olives, sauteed spinach, fresh garlic. Extra sauce, cooked well done. My husband loves pepperoni but likes this pizza better.
953	614	Romantic cozy Russian place!
54561	614	Amazing food, live entertainment. Great place!
50343	614	the caprioskas are the best here. infused vodka with mint. strawberry is the best flavor - not too sweet or overpowering

56139	626	You must try their chicken dumplings. Simply amazing :)

1090	631	Get the Rev. Al Sharpton, fried. You won't regret it!
135804	631	Usually a bit of a wait. Avoid Sunday's unless you like tourists and slow service. The food isn't the best soul food in the city.
21380	631	Oh my god, the best friday I've had in a Long time, why? I did nothing, except go to the best soul food joint on 116th street. They don't deliver so order ahead and pick up or just go there order to g
264722	631	The Salmon Croquettes (Kid Capri) are delicious but the 3 half-dollar size portion is more fitting of an appetizer.
1042	632	order a Bellini Martini they are srumptious
15416	632	Oysters to start, followed by tuna tartare, then... the steak \/ salmon\/ short ribs. You can't go wrong!

105313	639	Soup dumplings. That's all you need to know.
23420	639	Go to Joe Shanghai and order the Crab Soup Dumplings.
752	639	Their service has been a bit on a decline. Remember they already include the tip on your bill. So don't pay more if they are not doing it right.
1499	639	One of my favorite places to eat in New York.
196154	639	The closest thing to authentic soup dumplings in new york.  The crispy beef is also really good.
24230	639	Quite a wait, but the soup dumplings are worth it! Want more than soup dumplings? Crispy whole yellow fish! Crispy jumbo prawns, another plus.
14862	639	Ask for Melvin.  You'll have the food before you finish ordering.  Yikes.  :-)
60535	639	After you have the soup dumplings, get the shanghai fried rice! Egg & scallions, the best!

229664	648	Dinner was amazingg. Their lemon tart is the best I've tasted in NY
19603	648	I will try it this morning...
1319	649	I walked in and asked the bartender if they offered Christmas-style salsa dressing, and he didn't know what that meant. This place should not be allowed to use the name \
68409	653	Fast service, plenty of hot tea, mostly oily grub & cash only.  Do yourself a favor & stick with the steamed buns. Those are \
88145	653	Take some on the go.
616	654	If someone else is picking up the tab, look for the Pappy Van Winkle on the whiskey menu.
16255	654	The $11.95 burger is amazing for lunch. Add cheese and bacon for $1 each.
140970	654	You can't go wrong with the rib sampler!! Also try the mac & cheese!!
38363	654	The Pulled Pork sandwich is awesome! And the cornbread is really good too.

224128	654	Try the Creamed Spinach (via @Foodspotting)
31247	654	One of my favorite spots. Mac and cheese WAY overrated though
95346	654	I second the spicy cheese fries - there's just something about pigging out from a bucket that adds to the allure! My friend was pleased with the huge gluten-free menu that's mostly unadvertised.
36758	654	Either go for any of the ribs, or try the Rhapsody In Cue. And after the dinner head downstairs for some live Jazz.
46145	654	Ask for the fry bread with toffee instead of chipotle butter. and get it for dessert!
43127	654	The brisket sandwich is the best in NYC. Get it. Love it. Thank me later.

82569	717	Get the eggplant parm-Seeds ooze out the sides, tomato sauce laps at the edges, cheese gums up the works, and the eggplant itself has dissolved into something unidentifiable deep in the sandwich. Mmm.
1627	718	Get the peekeye crab salad. Awesome.
59619	718	Ask for the price before you order the specials- they were almost $10 more than other entrees (and not worth it)
8550	721	Best catfish in NYC
82569	721	Invariably, the oysters will be ice-cold and perfectly shucked, plunked down without ceremony -- a throwback to when oysters were an everyman food. All they need is a squirt of lemon

104	753	The best rustic Italian food we've had in NYC. The octopus and baccala appetizers are winners and the beef tagliata entree slayed. Also, great atmosphere and super friendly service.

202494	769	I can't get over the rat that was seen on top of the cheesecakes a couple years ago. Google it please. If that's what their secret crack ingredient is count me out! no matter how good they are.

2720	769	Epic breakfast!
9040	770	Go to Florio's to enjoy great sigars, inside. You'll probably feel like you're in a soprano's episode. You might run into John Perry Barlow.
205455	771	Not as good as Chinatown, but not bad for this neck of the woods.  You can order off menu.
50489	772	Classic, unforgettable, and fantastic.  This is one of the top places on the bucket list along with the pyramids of Giza.  The fried chicken is a nice surprise as is the\u2026 (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
13618	772	With all the mobster photos lining the walls, there\u2019s no hiding the mafia connection behind this East Harlem institution - I'd buy some of their pasta sauces on the way out, you filthy animal!
24873	773	Try the Spicy Bloody Mary - And the adult drinks are good too... ~Uncle Deno and Greg (via @Foodspotting)
78275	773	Great fare, cocktails and ambiance but beware the aggressive vultures that like to swarm, then attack. Pretending to speak another language usually helps.

262073	773	The bartender who wears all the different ties is GREAT!!!!

89566	784	So many good tapas to choose from. Didn't even get to the paella. Bacon wrapped shrimp was underwhelming but the croquetas were bomb. Check in on foursquare for free sangria. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
12736	784	Paella is delicious, as well as the sangria!!!
50489	787	This is where Andrew Carmellini got his start.  The food is still sublime although it is a little on the fancy side. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

47859	788	Split several appetizers\/first courses among your group. Then order the biggest steak on the menu. Dip the heavenly fries in the other-worldly marrow butter that comes with the steaks.
1826	788	Glad they finally got rid of the paper straws for their bloody mary.
34281	788	Large bloody Mary. Then any of the food, cause its all amazing!
64130	792	salads are for sharing. love the venetian cocktail. it's a mistake not to order mushrooms.  scallops are unreal, and the gritty texture you taste isn't sand; it's salt.
196154	792	The hen of the woods mushrooms:  intense flavor.  Striped Bass:  perfectly cooked.  The beet salad was also noteworthy.  For dessert, try the tangerine buttermilk sorbet. Delish!

24873	801	Try the Shrimp cake - First course (via @Foodspotting)
119448	801	Way too expensive for the tastes\/portion. Dinners had weak flavors. Salmon tartar was pretty good. Pic is chile relleno
211609	801	We got into Bobby Flay completely by accident. We didn\u2019t really watch the shows until after we ate at Mesa Grill, first found by checking out Restaurant Week.

163156	807	Miso broth is way too salty leaving my ramen experience quite disappointing... Stick to the veg dumpling soup or watch out for the salty miso - didnt enjoy that!
163156	807	Green tea mousse and sweet potato pudding ... The veggie dumpling soup is great and very filling for $6!
210809	807	The Tori (chicken) nanban-don is pretty good.

41694	812	Only good Chicken Fried Steak I've found in the city.
27367	812	I've sampled a lot to be fair & cause I was hungry, but they may have the best BLT in the city. At least below 23rd cause that's where most of my testing was done. Knickerbocker is a closetie

122027	840	good american spot between so many turistic places around the area! And order hot chokolate!! Beautiful

80104	1354	Solid margherita pizza - worth returning for if in the vicinity. Salads are completely forgettable.
62189	1360	Pasta is bland and horrible. It's not even al dente. Do not get. Although the sausage was grilled to perfection but wasn't good enough to save the dish.

211167	1393	What used to be my favorite pizza place on NYC is now serves mostly over priced day-old slices which they overcook so you won't notice how long they've been sitting out. Order a fresh pizza instead

63432	1395	HORRIBLE service. Pizza tastd great BUT it was cold. No one told us it was ready. Then they took forever finding salt. Get takeout, ask for it hot, get a drink from the nearby coke machine and go to b

238993	2540	I am the only white person here. And the bathroom stalls are see through
72	2541	not on the menu: ask for the cotton candy. usually a table with kids gets it--and then the whole place wants it
15416	2541	Tribeca is my favorite location. Reasonably priced wine and delicious food. Check out the ground floor bar or, if you're with a large group, the large, circular booth upstairs.
27292	2541	Seriously. It's like when you have an empty cupboard of food and experiment with what's left... Highly disappointing!
23264	2561	The best pizza you can possibly eat in New York City. Others will scream about Grimaldi's or some other place, the is no better pizza than Di Fara. Take the Q train to Ave J, you will never regret it

60486	3184	That's my name!
11023	3184	Double Shack Burger + Milk Shake together is afternoon coma death.  Pick one or the other, and toss in some fries.
196154	3184	I know, everyone comes here for burgers, but half the time I get the bird dog and swig it down with a frozen custard.  Is that so wrong?
7599	3201	If you buy the wifi, don't log out. Regardless of how long you bought, logging out ends your wifi access.
77968	3201	Excellent place to do some work and enjoy a hearty meal. The chicken fingers with honey balsamic sauce is great!

29383	3246	Food OK, but the 20% service charge is not reflected in any of the service they provide, like the $30 dlls house wine, warm bread served only once, or just 2 waitersfor the whole restaurant. Don't go.

195669	3412	Love this place -- GREAT food \/ ambiance and very very affordable. Though, it gets very loud \/ crowded on the weekends after 9pm, so I'd go early if you want to chat without losing your voice!
52312	3412	nowhere else can you eat this cheap and this good - the Kang Gai is heaven.
54488	3412	Fried Calamai is great!! Well seasoned and great with plum sauce!
64130	3412	excellent thai - loved the nuur kraprow, kang panang gai, and spicy noodles (they aren't that spicy). cash only.

34460	3423	This place is BYOB. So i think the food is good here and worth the money, but keep in mind that this place is BYOB. And I am writing this review while i'm still here. BYOB. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
26055	3423	My friend calls this food \
26055	3423	Honestly, this place sucks. If you like Indian food you won't recognize what you're served here.
52284	3423	The butter chicken is amazing here. Make sure to go to the downstairs restaurant
98138	3423	I wonder what the utility bill looks like for all those lights. You want to go to the restaurant on the top right. There appears to be 3 others that look the same. We got to celebrate a bday! Oh man.
943	3432	The desserts here are ridiculously good, even though they have no meat in them.
82569	3432	Winner of Best Patio Dining in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! The back garden and surprisingly delicious raw food make it an urban oasis.

24438	3432	If you need\/want raw this is the premier place for it
78275	3432	If you want to try flavors you've probably never tasted before, try the Pear Ravioli or Lemon Pasta, both incredibly tart (if that's your thing). Desserts are a home run in a new kind of ballpark.
78275	3432	Slap your tastebuds into shape with the raw and vegan offerings. Safer things on the menu (if this is your first raw experience) are the Lasagna and Tamales.
3744	3432	Try the raw lasagne (via @Foodspotting)
7599	3432	Spanking and Goji High smoothies are awesome.
196154	3432	I love the menu here, and the patio is perfect!
11075	3432	here's the trick to sitting outside: call to make a reservation. they won't give you a seat as a walk-in. also green apple juice & raw lasagna is sooo good.
11075	3432	zucchini lasagna + malbec + salted chocolate caramel tart = yum! plus, they have ferreira port. :-)
54073	3432	Sit outside and order one of everything. Lasagna. Burger. Taco salad. Shakes. EVERYTHING is good here!
43127	3432	This place is VERY expensive and all you get are a few vegetables. Not worth it imo.

2442	3511	if you go, sit outside. it felt so dirty inside. the food was pretty blah, so i'd say go somewhere else.

59479	3521	If you don't eat, there is a 8 dollar per person minimum. A pitcher of Ichiban costs 8 dollars. The food doesn't. The menus have gross anime porn on them.
51445	3524	The fake steak au poivre is a must have!

195601	3575	Don't miss the pudding in the back! Chocolate chip cookie dough and cream pudding... I'd die!
34460	3575	This is where I go to get my sugar fix during afternoons at work. Cupcakes are solid, cheesecakes are so rich (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
27404	3575	You have made a wonderful decision. Pistachio for sure. Sassy>Sexy Red Velvet.

953	3582	my fav cafe in all NYC. great working environment, friendly, crowd changes throughout day into night
17476	3582	Skip this place.  Make an iced coffee and hang out in your apartment.  It's cheaper, there are probably less screaming children, and your bathroom is probably cleaner.
34131	3582	diverse crowd. comfortable. good variety of food and drinks. always something new going on. you'll feel at home.
49714	3582	Prices are cheap but can do without the live band

66227	4156	Bathrooms!
49391	4156	The chocolate chip cookies at Jacques Torres are phenomenal.

40518	4310	Delicious pasta & light salads.
2856	4310	Tip: ignore hostess (rude) but otherwise good spot.
11372	4310	The gorgonzola fondue with fries are signature. The Eggs Benedict and French Toast are legendary.
53783	4310	Become friends the black guy with hat. He  surely can ditch the sign-up sheet to wait for a table & get u a table, regardless of the 1st come 1st serve. Maybe they should start taking reservations.ugh
59619	4310	try the monte cristo sandwich- a great combination of \

19732	4342	Doing the omakase. It's really the only way.
196154	4342	get the omakase, period.  The crepe mille feuille for dessert is good too!
193062	4342	The Omakase was terrific, 22 pieces of sushi in all, with a foie gras that just melts in your mouth in between, the only thing is that some of the pieces were just different versions of the same fish.
196154	4342	You must get the omakase. Will change your life.  Also, try the crepe mille feuille for dessert. It's awesome.
5663	4376	I recommend the steamed veggie dumplings. Hardy and tasty.

23420	4376	Love this place.  Steamed pork dumplings are my favorite.
14506	4389	If you have a cold, there's nothing better than a huge bowl of Lichee Nut's minced chicken corn soup, esp as takeout or delivery.

22719	4392	The milk shakes are awesome and a must-have. You can even share them with a friend =)
27184	4392	Try the Leg Of Lamb Sandwich - Yum yum (via @Foodspotting)
4241	4392	They do Breakfast really well. Dinner not so much. Avoid the turkey, always dry
31403	4392	The worst service in the country.
31403	4392	Worst service ever. The place is cool, the food ok but we were almost finishing, they took out the plate bring the check and ask us to leave. Seinfeld is a great show, but this restaurant sucks!!!
27297	4392	The milkshakes are the only reason to come. Food was pretty blah.
209553	4403	Tip the pretty and friendly waitress! Nevermind the other one.
1090	4403	The inside is very dark.
45210	4403	Try the profitterol! It's very light chocolate with some whipped cream.
145413	4403	The service is so slow here...
50152	4403	Cash only spot
6083	4429	Artichoke dip, macaroni and cheese, cocktails
30476	4429	Only place I eat at in Manhattan. Moto in Williamsburg is the only restaurant better than Freemans.
69093	4429	Superior mixology, The Old Palamino. Sit at the back bar
121095	4429	A hidden gem. Check out the lounge upstairs
10760	4429	The artichoke dip is insanely good
29831	4429	Without a doubt, one of my favorite NYC spots!
33560	4429	the alley might remind you of the scene from Batman when Bruce Wayne's parents get killed.
57056	4429	Really disappointing\/slow service upstairs.
105569	4429	Get a lattè with your granola to start. Both very good. Then take one Skillet eggs & add a Freeman's Cocktail: rye, lemon juice, pomegranate & bitters.
29177	4429	good for brunch
15416	4429	Spinach artichoke dip is unlike any other and a must.
5009	4429	Artichoke Dip is pretty killer, as is the egg, cheese, and bacon skillet. Take a look at the brunch cocktail menu, too\u2014you can't go wrong with any of it.
8952	4429	Great food, cool vibe. Bad server last night who could not be bothered with us. Literally ran away from the table in the middle of a drink order. Heads up service is part of the experience. I'm done
141044	4429	The best rose and the best mussels.

43440	4442	Spices vanilla möjito is such a delicious drink. Wow.
5566	4448	People rave about the brick grilled chicken.
238035	4448	OMG the brick chicken is %$&@ing brilliant. SO good. I enjoyed every single bite of crispy skin and delicious meat.
80104	4448	The burger, biscuits & gravy, house-made baked goods...everything on the menu was fantastic. Only glitch we found was the lack of service in the \

65308	4461	While the vanilla vanilla cupcakes are amazing and much better than Magnolias... The banana cake is to DIE for.
133605	4461	The Peanut Butter Pie is quite possibly my favorite, but you can't go wrong with a red velvet or a yellow daisy cupcake. Hands down my favorite bakery.
25807	4472	There's a cozy downstairs area behind the counter. If upstairs is too crowded go there!
34710	4472	Vegan Peanut butter chocolate chip cookies are bangin'. They also have great coffee.
56276	4472	Iced coffee with coffee ice cubes - not THE best ice coffee, but much more consistent over time compared regular cubes. Worth a try.
86519	4472	Staff were extremely friendly, space is very nice. Small, but if it gets too crowded, there's space downstairs, and just quiet enough for a meeting or to get some work done! (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
30484	4472	The iced coffee is the best because the ice cubes are frozen coffee. Also, the salads are fresh and absolutely delicious.
50152	4472	The arugula and beet salad was delish

616	4523	Feels more cool than the food is good (hidden staircase, no sign).  Pass on the paella, but shoot for the chinese sausages.  ps:  BYOB.
58	4523	Asian small plates.  Dishes you'll definitely want to order: Chinese sausages and the mushrooms with bamboo shoots.

3809	4561	One of the best burgers I have had! Great \

4463	4561	Ask the concierge to place a pick up order and skip the line.
28946	4561	Yum Yum Yum. Try to snag a table if you can, otherwise crowd in with some strangers in a corner.
43905	4561	Terrible service - they basically accused me of lying about ordering fries, and not paying for them when I had. Also the burgers are tiny - not worth $14.50 w fries & drink! Go to Shake Shack instead.

34125	4640	Received a private tour of the Per Se kitchen after eating at it.
196154	4640	For those of you that cannot make the pilgrimage to French Laundry in Yountville, this culinary destination is worth the trip.  Go big and order the 10 course with the wine pairing!
68409	4640	Spontaneously go to Per Se without a reservation & sit in the bar room.  The food is just as superb as is the view! http:\/\/MichelleC.tv
89566	4640	It was pretty damn awesome. Just think it's way overpriced. It's not twice as good as places like Jean Georges or Le Bernardin. But top notch. Ask for a tour of the kitchen\u2026 (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
202698	4640	Go for the 9 course. It's amazing.
231094	4640	Most expensive meal ever ate in NYC...worth every dime (his dime anyway)

165056	4734	Lunch menu pizza changes daily and is often the best pizza you'll ever eat.

41558	4734	Share the steak or the chicken between 2

66148	4734	The atmosphere is great on a warm summers evening when they open the restaurant up! Foods great - recommend the swordfish with artichokes. The linguinetti was also lovely.

71372	4734	Got here at 4:30 pm to an EMPTY space for some drinks and apps and they nearly turned us away b\/c we weren't eating a full meal. WTF?  Finally convinced them to let us stay. Food was good, though.
211609	4735	I absolutely love 21! I feel apart of history sitting where Frank Sinatra once did\u2026 plus there is something so romantic about a REAL prohibition speakeasy!
8309	4735	The burger's are amazing. Ask to sit by the fireplace and grad a drink in the big red chairs.
16170	4749	Not to be confused with downstairs BLT Fish Shack. All fish is to die for but make sure you leave room for dessert. Apple Strudel in particular.
15416	4749	Pick a Fish is the move. Salmon, if you're lucky (it sells out). Lobster Roll and Crab Dip also excellent choices.
28682	4767	Great sandwiches! And quick service!

208452	4797	Lobster mac and cheese, duh. But the sweet potato fries here are KILLER

33560	4829	Use the restroom straight ahead. It's a shrine to Telly Savalas.
33560	4829	Saganaki rocks. Order it bitch.
5183	4830	The 3 outdoor seats are the bomb
53109	4830	The red, white and blue is a great deal.  A PBR and six blue point oysters for $8.00.  The raw bar sampler is also good if you want to try all the oysters.  Expect a wait if you go on a weekend.
11466	4830	Angels on horseback. Raw oysters wrapped in bacon. Proving yet again that bacon makes everything better.
16447	4834	This is how Brighton was meant to be. One of the few places left with that opulent charm circa 1995. Come for the food, stay for the show, and get carried out from the vodka.

128419	4840	Burrata & Fior Duet. Period.
89566	4840	Surprisingly fresh $1 oysters for happy hour every day from 7-10pm. Service isn't always great but the oyster special makes up for it in my book. (2 of 4 petals via Fondu)

36259	4840	Awesome food and service.

50730	4843	The bartenders suck balls here.  But the food is great.
70016	4843	WARNING: Apparently this place will give you the Real Housewife badge if you are friends with Bravo.  Not the coolest badge of honor for a 24 year old bachelor...
27297	4843	Love much of the food here, but avoid the red velvet cake. Way too dense.
29638	4843	Wouldn't classify this as \

204517	4850	Bun Xao and an order of spring rolls. Done.

45958	4889	The Brussels sprouts with chorizo are to die for!
75858	4889	Ok, so this place is NOT a coffee shop.  It's a restaurant with a wonderful menu.  A little pricey, but worth every penny.  Get a bottle of wine with dinner, the atmosphere requires it.
99843	4889	French Roast now has happy hour at midnight . Weird, I know but who doesn't want a deal at that time of night. It's from midnight to 4am. Specials on wine, cocktails, and beer. So stop on by!
17723	4889	I'm with Sherry Z.  Horrible service EVERY TIME I have been there yet I keep going back.  Food is indeed mediocre as well.
287	4889	Dress light: air-conditioning is suspect. Also, undress fully before entering sauna-restroom.
42214	4898	The quintessential Mexican food establishment in Greenpoint. Great prices, fast service, and a help-your-self beer cooler with frosted mugs. They also make a decent burger.
17885	4898	Best chips and guacamole I've had in NY

45720	4920	The Duck, Pork, and Chicken Congee is so amazing. Add a little soy sauce to it, thank me later.
46026	4920	You can't go wrong ordering congee, but do not miss out on the baked rice dishes and casseroles.
11466	4920	This place has much better congee than it's nearby competitors, worth the trek away from the subway
59479	4920	If you order by phone they have egg drop soup. If you order in person, they do not have egg drop soup.
107013	4920	forget silverware, eat the house chicken special w\/ your hands..

96969	4954	SO dank! Definitely go here!
37873	4954	The soup dumplings is comparable, not as good as queens location though, fish (seabass)  ordered wasn't as fresh though:(. If u want dumplings without the wait of other spot, come over here!

215956	5054	This Starbucks demonstrates why the change to free wifi for all was a bad idea :-( Hardly ever get free seats here.
74287	5076	Castros is one the best authentic Mexican restaurants in BK. Hands down!
21442	5076	Good place for take-out, or an affordable hour or two to hang out with friends. I was a big fan of their burritos and quesadillas here but everything is pretty good. Outdoor dining's great in Spring.
10530	5212	eat slowly so u can maximize byob time

62466	5222	Awesome atmosphere, I highly recommend sitting at the bar if you can! The bartenders are amazing!

123414	5426	Don't bother with the pig gig
89566	5426	Pulled pork was great. Big seating area in the back with big tv's and I think an upstairs. Outta the way for most but if you're in the hood, definitely worth a look. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
2605	5426	Limited seating! Great bbq but don't bring ambivilent freinds...this place is for bbq lovers only!

7007	5455	#6 is the bomb! Soo good
82569	5474	Their eggplant rollatini is one of the greatest: eggplant fried either with crumbs or without, rolled around snow-white ricotta cheese, smothered in tomato sauce, then mantled in mozzarella.
15443	5474	The best waitstaff in the East Village.
31216	5474	Beware it's a cash only establishment but they do have a ATM available.
42406	5474	Really digging the #vegan menu. The eggplant parm is awesome and made with daiya cheese!  And don't forget to get the cannoli!
63917	5474	Leaving a second tip on this. If you like olive garden you will be impressed.
63917	5474	Wow. I think overrated is an understatement. Garlic bread was something my baby cousin could make. Service sucked. PASS
43905	5474	Don't know what others were smoking when they wrote tips but this place is NOT good. Cosy atmosphere but food is totally average. Saltimbocca was bland, service scattered. Feels like a tourist trap.
6993	5474	Make sure to try the avocado bruschetta
47769	5515	Umm, this place isn't good.
50134	5515	The Frozen Margaritas are awesome!

102	5553	This is a Ft Greene\/Brooklyn 'see and be seen' type of spot. Go before 4pm if you can and snag a spot in the shade. It gets packed and somewhat obnoxious come evening-time.

6741	5606	Seriously, the toffee pudding (cake) is outta sight. We often skip dessert elsewhere to come to Beast for the pudding. Also, the rest of the menu is outstanding.
2448	5606	They made up for it with basket of baked goodies. Yay.

152611	5744	So I tried the fish tacos that everyone was talking about. I was skeptical. BOMB!!! Now I have to find other places to compare
25336	5744	Pork tacos and rice are a delight. Breakfast margarita, too.
12802	5744	the best mexican food outside Mexico, no doubt about it.

20555	5744	Hands down the best tequila selection in NYC. BOOM.
57437	5744	During lunch time, place your order by phone and pick it up...... They take forever when you order in person!!!!!!! But its worth the wait :p
69093	5744	Great place, but food is far better at Mexican Radio across the street! Shredded chicken burrito is best in the city!!!

22896	5760	get the contraband chicken. really, it's amazing.
50223	5760	All the burgers are GREAT... but there's a special one NOT on the menu, called THE YARD BURGER. It's got a really SPICY HOT Jamaican marinade. Sweet potato fries balance it out & have plenty of water!

82569	5779	Their double-chocolate crumb cake is divine!
145611	5779	Everything is delicious. EVERYTHING.
5663	5779	Believe the hype. Babycakes makes superior treats. My favorite are the brownie cupcake and pumpkin cupcake (which is seasonal).
21442	5854	Not as good and more expensive than John's Coffee Shop but has a lot more of a New York atmosphere with signed images of news anchors and foreign currency on the wall. Owner is really talkative too
2348	5854	Just remember its cash only at Mike's
82569	5862	They brought Shrimp Tacos to Choice Eats- Corn tortilla, sauteed shrimp with chile chipotle, garlic, and avocado slice. Yummy!
47991	5862	Tacos are by far mediocre. Go to Queens for amazing tacos at 1\/3 of the price. Good election of tequilas. Should you dine.. Ask for the yellow habanero sauce if you dare. Killer!!!

10932	5863	try the pork & watermelon salad. seriously. do.

30519	5863	Fodors recommended as a 'cheap eat', & then ordered Chilli Crab not realising that it would rocket the bill (!) - but it was worth it. Pork belly & watermelon too - who knew? So tasty... :)
22056	5863	Cheapest wine? $40. Please.
22056	5863	Stop your gushing. This place is seriously over-priced on all levels: from wines to apps to mains. Get on the train and go to Chinatown. Save yourself about $100 for two, easily.
82569	5863	This Choice Eats attendee brought Fatty Devils (Deviled Eggs) to the event and handed them all out before the night was over! Delicious!
72	5867	check out the ice teas here (all diff varieties, herbs, etc)

24973	5886	Love this bar!  The drinks and bartenders are awesome!  Love their little patio!  Can't wait to go back!
64678	5892	Bit disappointed by Red Lobster to be honest. I personally thought that Ruby Tuesdays across the street was an all round better experience.
250159	5892	The cheddar biscuits were cooked a little too long...
103216	5892	Don't come here with large parties. Keep it under 7 if you don't want to be separated.
133254	5892	Never go with a starving wife lmao #impatient
17435	5892	Oh Emm Geee.. if you're reading this, turn around, pick up your shit, and leave this restaurant immediately. TOTAL BARF.
61567	5899	Cash only!!! The brunch is good, standard, a little expensive. But the actual building is very cool, and the views of Brooklyn bridge are excellent!! Definitely good place to bring a visitor.
95346	5899	The best huevos rancheros I've ever had, goes well with one of their press drinks. Look out for the super tall waiter! Side note: fiancé proposed to me in retro photo booth here :)

202998	5899	They need a square. Cash only is retarded.

6359	5900	Gray and rainy days feel like Paris when coupled with an espresso and eclair from Almondine.
8756	5900	So they have great pastries and coffee that's basically rocket fuel, but the most overlooked item is their soup.  Made fresh daily and delicious (if a bit pricey at $5 a cup).

213346	5904	Whole wheat everything with bacon scallion cream cheese

4766	5960	The whole menu is superb, the black rice makes any of the dishes better. And the hot sauces are to the left kinda hidden so look for them.
29301	5960	Cash Only. Otherwise excellent.
42283	5960	Try the Coconut French Toast w\/ lime syrup and diced banana, a top brunch treat.

87461	6023	Bring a sword
33560	6023	Use the Ninja entrance!
195601	6023	Probably the worst food I've had going out to dinner in manhattan... But they're attempt to entertain you via ninja outfits is slightly amusing- overall; wouldn't recommend.

21442	6185	Thin crust, more of a traditional Italian style pie like you'd find at Lombardi's or Grimaldi's. Tried the Arugula Pie as per Food Network's Ted Allen's suggestion, it was good but sausage is the best

50377	6261	Get the Omakase for the full Gari experience.
8561	6261	Worth every penny!!
27646	6261	The omakase is very pricy but more than worth it. By far my best sushi experience outside Japan.
201836	6261	They do vegetarian omakase upon request! Get the omakase at the bar. 14 veggie pieces for ~$50 or 14 seafood pieces for ~$90. Friendly service and the best sushi I've had make it worth every cent.
20817	6261	The salmon pieces with tomatoe on top is original and a must have!!

30961	7455	Best pizza in town \/ my one true love
33560	7455	Eat a bar pie... at the bar.
33560	7455	If you can't pay your bill, they make you chop wood for the pizza oven in the basement.
33560	7455	The VIP room is downstairs.
59612	7455	Note: It's minimum $10 if using a credit\/debit card for a takeout order.
40642	7455	The pizza here is pretty decent. But the other meals such as pasta are barely average.
50834	7482	It's not on the menu but they will make sesame tofu for you if you ask nicely. Yum yum my fav!
50834	7482	Get the sesame tofu, not on the menu, but they know what to do.
82569	7507	The $6 veg platter has herb-and-chickpea orbs that are freshly fried-they nestle into whatever they're dropped upon, whether it be cabbage slaw, heap of pickles and pickled peppers, or well of tahini
214268	7507	Food is great. They'll show you NO love, though. Smiling is forbidden.
48072	7507	Yes falafel is good. Shwarma is my fav. Add hummus & beets to any sandwich. So messy but yummy.
24518	7507	We meant to eat BBQ and instead ended up with falafel and all sorts of assorted deliciousness. A wise, wise move.
78275	7519	Everything, and I mean everything from Dressler is so well executed with beautiful explosion of flavors. The raspberry beret cocktail is refreshing and light. Duck is tender and melts in your mouth.
50218	7519	Lamb Shanks are the shiz!
78275	7519	Top picks for Brunch: Eggs Benedict, Dressler and the Omelette. Fresh squeezed OJ has just the right amount of pulp and sweetness.
32738	7519	Love this place. One of the very best restaurants in Brooklyn, and still feels a bit like a discovery.
125191	7519	Great appetizers. Lamb shank was alright, while salmon was excellent. Try their oysters!
26958	7521	Small, medium and large dim sum plates are all the same low price of $2.00 each from Monday - Friday!
26958	7521	Get the sweet and savory lao sah Bao here \

80608	7524	allow your eyes to adjust before venturing down to the candle lit bathrooms
22683	7524	My current favorite steakhouse in the city. I say get the Rib Eye over the sirloin or the filet. Amazing, complete with Flintstone-esque protruding bone. ; )
24436	7535	soup + 1\/2 sandwich combo for lunch!
64130	7535	3-6pm half off coffee and tea
222355	7535	The guys @ 'wichcraft are great! Try the cranberry walnut bread, you won't be disappointed. Cool music also.
69153	7542	Start at the bar with a Negroni Sbagliato.  In dining room, start with the salumi board and a bottle of red - you can't go wrong!  Also, it's best if Jason is the dj....
208592	7542	Live here
28031	7557	That catfish could possibly be better than the chicken.
7599	7557	The Superbowl (three sides plus biscuit or bread) is huge, filling, and good. Mac and cheese is solid.
36758	7557	Get the Fried Chicken Box, with Mac n Cheese and Collards on the side.
26202	7557	Sweet tea (and yeah, chicken biscuit).
29177	7557	makes me not miss Chick-fil-a so much
9686	7557	Most delicious buttery biscuit & juicy fried chicken
10909	7557	Fried Chicken Box with an extra side is more than enough for a discerning pair of eaters; just get two though, you'll be happier.
26202	7557	There's lots of great food here, but you should only order the chicken biscuit your first 20 visits.  Until Chick Fil A gets its act together and opens a real store in NYC, this is as good as it gets.
22719	7557	awesome southern food in the heart of the 'burg! =)
96231	7557	Fuck. Yeah. Hush puppies, homemade wine coolers. Need I say more? This place is the jam
217242	7557	Call me old fashioned, but the fried chicken box hits the spot.
99	7557	Holy chicken biscuits! This place is good.
152611	7557	Carolina pulled pork, grits n biscuits with gravy. Southern flair and amazing
1042	7578	get the blue shot. dangerous and delicious ... tastes like a popsicle?????
5159	7583	Get a burger with goat cheese!!! Amazing. Also the peanut butter and chocolate cupcake.
143431	7583	Standard burger with Jack Cheese was off the hook. GET FRIES with it.
1319	7594	There's a mouse that resides under the raised area in the back. DO NOT KILL HIM. He's the mascot ok?
102	7594	You can spot neighborhood notables like actor Jeffrey Wright often hanging out here, playing on their Macs.
102	7594	Pet puppies, all day, urrday.
1317	7594	In addition to great coffee and a surly French owner, this place is typical of the nabe in number of hot mixed race patrons.
5021	7594	Don't sit at the counter - it's shaky. Eat the birds breakfast. Boiled egg and cucumber! Who knew?
5009	7594	Apparently Smooch is going to discontinue Internet on Sundays, the only day I come by to work. Looks like they've lost my business...
1317	7594	My favorite bite is the Tamarama, flatbreads topped w\/sliced hard boiled egg, beefsteak tomato, avocado, evoo, and fresh pepper. Comes with a Flat White (coffee). Dreamy!
102	7594	Site of one of the most epic mayorship battles in Ft Greene history..
69836	7599	Best Margaritas ever!
60486	7599	Horrible.. Ordered the 'dirty' enchildas and found a super long hair in it... Fail!
160877	7599	I got roofied here. Don't do it.
90026	7627	S'mac has a dozen different flavors of mac & cheese, all available gluten free.  What more can be said?
72	7627	i usually get the masala or four-cheese or spanish.
72	7627	under pressure of hunger and the long line behind you, order the Cajun and the Masala (both major munch size). sit at a big table (you'll need it, fatty) and wonder why
98858	7627	Best mac and cheese in the city. Come during off hours to get a seat. Try the Cajun it's amazing! If it's too crowded go next door and get a take and bake and bring it home with you for later.
25807	7627	Try the Thanksgiving Mac N Cheese - Turkey, gravy & cranberry. OMFG! (via @Foodspotting)
14912	7627	If you can't pick a favorite and you're not going there alone, consider the S'MAC Sampler so you can try eight of their most popular varieties.
14912	7627	The alpine is amazing...Gruyere cheese, and unbelievably think chunks of slab bacon.
75858	7627	Grab n' Go.  Amazing mac n' cheese.  I really like the Masala and the Garden lite.  My advice is to order out and take it to a nearby bar where they don't serve food.
8210	7627	Line was ridiculous, but the Buffalo Chicken mac was AWESOME and best enjoyed on the steps next door.
22719	7627	best mac and cheese ever! If you don't believe that you can make a meal out of gourmet Mac and Cheese, you need to check this place out =)
30546	7627	Stay away from the Buffalo chicken.  Its just frank's red hot sauce and cheese.  Absolutely gross.  Had to get up before I puked
147338	7627	Overrated. Go to mac bar instead xo
14912	7627	If you're lactose intolerant, consider the 75-cent lactaid pills so you don't have to miss out on the amazing mac & cheese here.

22056	7656	Meal was really really good. Interesting mix of flavors. Burger was a standout. Avoid the dessert. It's made offsite and ours, the flourless chocolate thing, was inedible. And not removed from bill.

183505	7663	Square slice with fresh mozzarella is a great choice in this neighborhood
29831	7663	One of SoHo's better slices.
40771	7663	Get a piece of the square aka sicillian. Ask to not get a corner piece
4787	7663	Scene from Men In Black 2 was filmed her (watched it happen). Don't be fooled, this place is no joke. Pizza is great. They don't need the publicity.
72	7664	come here on a rainy afternoon. sit in the corner by the window. get one of the sets. order up a tea you've never had before. tune out everyone and read your book.

47991	7675	Can't beat Gazpacho and 1\/2 sandwich. Great deal.
178972	7677	Our waiter BILLY was rude and unpleasant. He kept forgetting coffee, coleslaw, and always made an excuse why he didn't have it.  When we asked for a soup spoon he said, \

91070	7678	Always make your burrito a wet one. ;)
52560	7680	These baristas are the worst most incompetent people ever. I used to be a barista so I have a lot of tolerance but OMFG!

82569	7723	The Minetta Burger \u2013 juicy and topped with aged cheddar is worth the wait at this Greenwhich Village legend.

196154	7723	Any burger aficionado must pay a visit here at least once.  And they are now open for lunch Wed. through Saturday until 3pm!
29177	7723	best fancy burger in town

47859	7749	Pork Ragù and a carafe of the house red.
32738	7749	I would avoid the 7:30-8:30 slot most days. We came on Wednesday at 8:30 and were seated immediately.

19997	7792	Awesome everything, plus good wifi and Stumptown coffee
6360	7792	Their sandwiches are awesome. Amazing bread. For dinner, for any time. Pasta is good, but I pine for those sandwiches.
196154	7794	The nutella crepe was a Sunday afternoon staple for years!! Lovely french cafe where you could literally spend an afternoon reading the paper and enjoying the menu.

49343	7796	Had the tiramisu - amazing.

15301	7797	best, hands down.
18213	7797	drinking a Rwanda remera red-eye. Wondering if the coffee in Africa will be any good. I'll report back next week!

124076	9526	Cheddar hush puppies are worth the splurge

4787	10032	I like the brunch here - but not the 30 minute wait. Get here early for that. Otherwise, skip it altogether. The Astoria has far too many better places to eat for the money...
40642	10032	Cozy diner. The hamburgers taste pretty great and same for the pastas. Brunch here is also quite tasty. Prices are a little more than Bel Aire a few blocks away which has food on par at times. But San
145340	10032	Great burger- cheap brunch!!! Make sure your entire party is there when you go so you can be seated right away :) enjoy
67801	10054	Why hand out a pager, if you're just gonna scream at the top of your lungs to get a customer to collect their food. The pager goes off after the foods ready. So obnoxious.
194220	10054	Lemon Chicken Orzo is a must try
26958	10057	Credit only and you need to know someone who works in the building to get into this exclusive cafe that has famous executive chefs and celebrities in it all the time.  Many movies were filmed in here.

40642	10197	Although a little more pricey: Fountain soda on tap with gigantic portions of fries (even for the small) and huge burgers. What more can you ask for?
20711	10197	Their bacon cheeseburger is delicious. Their regular order of fries is enough for two people.
53938	10197	Best burger and fries in the neighborhood. Try the double cheeseburger with Mayo and A-1 steak sauce.
214268	10211	The food isn't good. There's SO MANY good places to eat in W'burg, don't settle for this stuff. Taco Bell is better & Endless Summer is probably just around the corner. Do yourself a solid: stay away.

43905	10324	Amazing choc walnut brownies!! Free wifi! Potted palms! What more do you want?
6998	10324	On weekends or peak hours it can be hard to find a seat, but it's worth going for the coffee and a bagel or a tea biscuit

79142	10604	Try the Moist Brisket and spot it on Foodspotting!
193062	10604	The sweet tea and side dishes are great, I had the collard greens and baked beans; the bbq is a little overpriced and overrated to be truthful.
63524	10635	if you have an iphone, sit on the side closest to the starbucks next door, et voilà! free wifi!
57576	10635	Chicken salad... not recommended. Chk soup, is good.
5484	10635	Not worth the money....unless you're really hungry and need really bad faux-Japanese food...
69179	10635	It tastes like the food's been frozen and microwaved

51939	10761	Awesome coffee!!
670	10761	good chocolate muffins!
31616	10765	Been here a few times last year and loved it...tonight, not so much. The hostess was condesending, waiting 45 min btwn apps and entrees and everything was bland AND salty. Never again.
31616	10765	@Edward.. Dude that girl has been hoeing it up for the past 3 hours. Think she might working the streets.

46450	10784	Got the sampler was pleased with the amount of ribs, everything was yummy
26202	10784	The family style dinner option is like nothing I've ever seen anywhere else in New York.  Get a group of friends and feast on more fried chicken, ribs, mac & cheese, and collards than you can handle.
136450	10785	Arguably THE BEST Porterhouse for 2! Seriously... any amount less would be uncivilized!
72	10786	love having breakfasts here: not as packed as Balthazar in the mornings. go on a long early early run, then to an early meeting here and get the protein breakfast. tea on the side!

98756	10824	If you're a walk in, avoid the maître d\u2019 (the grey hair gentleman) he's a condescending prick. Food, service and bar staff are great.
7105	10824	Sashimi is VERY dangerous as they charge by the piece. Out bill for two (without wine) got over $300 very easily.
19335	10835	Their lunch menu is available on the weekends & is super cheap. For $7.50 you can get an appetizer & entree. Yum.
6120	10835	Nice breezy contemporary Thai restaurant, pad thai  is only $10 so you can't go wrong
25438	10835	Good food. HORRIBLE service.

13895	10853	Say hi to Nick, the owner.  Order the homemade guac, make it extra spicy. with jalapeños, and wash it down with one of their specialty Margaritas!
204517	10853	The fish tacos are worth the $ (go for the fried)
152611	10873	Shocked at how cheap the prices were in comparison to other NY places. Maine Lobster Roll is highly suggested
159682	10873	Never to return. Even with reservation Hostess was rude, nasty, aggressive! Not worth it.
199925	10873	Walked up and down the block 5 times def worth it!!!!
178067	10873	Not the place to start a Steak Tarte fight. Trust me.

72667	10897	The assorted BBQ platter is awesome and plenty of food with te banchan
78200	10904	I'm kinda pissed that this is an EXAMPLE. Never skip the burger. NEVER. By far, the greatest burger in the city. Get bacon and grilled onions.
8663	10904	Best Veggie Burger in NYC. Side of fries and a Porkslap beer make it a perfect meal.
31257	10904	Order the cheeseburger.  Get onion rings instead of fries.
24436	10904	royale with cheese. and chips with onion dip.
26055	10904	$3 pints during happy hour, but it ends at 7 & on Friday \/ Saturday you need to order food to sit outside
6243	10904	I was disappointed when our server mocked us for asking to split a $39 bill on two cards. She cited a $20 minimum and firmly said no. There's too many great restaurants in the area to come back here
183760	10904	Amazing burgers. Get the bacon royale with blue cheese.
33330	10904	Burgers are not great (fuck hype)
172476	10904	bacon royal with cheese  youre welcome  4-7 happy hour
37459	10904	eat the chicken fingers... best in the city
8466	10935	Get the manhattan and gnocchi -  top notch
72	10935	kmo says to either go here or maybe bring it back for late-night if working late (in the hood)
19732	10935	The vongole will make ur eyes wet w joy. And pain that you'll never produce anything as delicious in your entire miserable and tiny little  life. Eat it and weep motherfucker.
102	10935	The Pork Shank (Stinco!!) was great, very tender and delicious. Meatballs were tinier than expected and riceballs were larger, both were good but we were surprised they didn't come with any sauce.
82569	10947	Try the lamb meatballs with roasted green onion and spicy romesco sauce- this dish was featured at Choice Eats 2009
953	10947	Brunch: Expensive, not memorable, drinks not included.
5390	10947	FYI: The chipotle ketchup is NOT BBQ sauce.
64130	10947	they offer a whole suckling pig good for 10-12 people - comes with 3 sides (bread, greens, beans) + 2 appetizers and dessert for $600.
195588	10947	Worst Service in the East Village. Twice I've left in disgust. Saw a mouse, under cooked meat and nasty server\/manager!
10760	10965	The pork buns are insanely good: a massive slab of pork belly in a light fluffy bun.
11372	10965	The pork buns are good, but not as good as Fatty Crab in the WV.
238035	10965	Aside from the famed pork buns, the bok choy and the beef brisket are PHENOMENAL!!
63386	10965	Yummy ramen @ best pork buns in the city!
22056	10965	Pork buns are great but intense. If you order them don't get the pork ramen as well. It's a bit much. Both are great though. My girlfriend had the vege noodles, which were amazing.
11315	10965	Awesome food! They are not kidding about the Chilled Spicy Noodles. Good thing there's plenty of water. :)
140970	10965	Don't know what to get? You MUST order the Pork Steamed Buns as an appetizer. Try the Momofuku Ramen and enjoy it with the Piña Colada Soju! Bon Appetit!!

5009	11790	Such a cute place but apparently cannot make over easy eggs... 1st came overcooked, replacement was almost raw.
14175	11792	i'm all about the spicy cod roe onigiri.
6908	11792	They have delicious pastries in the morning.
116062	11792	The black seseme frappe is the most amzing beverage one can have!

24436	11802	Sunday brunch special: coffee, OJ, bloody mary, baked eggs, side of bacon. Happy.
2064	11802	Prix Fixe is a great deal. But I would pass on the hangar steak

59612	11806	Try the Spinach and Mushroom Omelette (via @Foodspotting)
22283	11846	DO IT. Truffle fries, or whatever. It's all good and the waiters are cute.
27588	11846	die hipster scum. food here is good, but the scene is like a Human Giant skit. skinny jeans, beards and asymmetric haircuts akimbo.
18213	11846	The egg sandwich is smashing. Subtle hints of sage, mustard and garlic. The bread the sandwich comes on is divine.
1317	11846	They're famous for their burger and it's well-deserved. But don't miss the fresh ricotta starter and the \
101472	11846	Ricotta w\/figs and honey. Every time. And the little table at the far end of the bar.
22056	11846	Fried oysters. Don't even look at the menu.

24772	11855	Also, the best wine\/deal is the AN\/2.  So good
24772	11855	Though the paella is out if this world, you need to order the fideua.   Crispier and tastier than the paella.
196154	11855	The seafood paella was life changing!  The best part about the authentic food here is the crispy bottom of the pan.  Yum!
126273	11855	If padron peppers are on the specials, a must!!!
196154	11855	definitely worth the wait, I had the paella de mariscos and it was delicious. Don't forget to scarf crispy bits at the bottom of the pan.

43127	11856	Oh wow. Tater tots. Do it.
64175	11860	Save 5 of their cardboard cup slips and return them for a free biscotti!
7461	11860	Bad news. Biscolatte no longer allows computers.  That's a big FAIL.  They need to re-think that policy.
7461	11860	Great coffee \/ biscotti.  I want to like this place, but such a bad vibe.  Been here several times, but on a recent visit, it was so disturbing to see someone treating others so rudely I had to leave.
312	11872	Enjoy waiting a long time for coffee? You are in luck.
72	11872	the smoked turkey sandwich is delicious. pick one up on the way to work, have a couple of bites and save the rest for an early lunch

4403	11872	2 words - corn muffin
19732	11872	I once saw a cute red head here. We kind of glanced at each other a few times. It was nice. And surprisingly thrilling considering this kind of thing happens all the time in this metropolis.
15236	11872	Power outlets are hard to find here
43905	11872	Could they BE any slower here?
202	11872	Power outlets are in the floor by the windows

616	11881	Naveen and I built half of the original foursquare prototype here (pre-SXSW 2009).  This was before I was drinking coffee, so I was downing like 5 hot a day here (someone's gotta pay for that wifi!)
45533	11881	I live for this java...and the owners and staff are so nice too!very loyal.

16255	11881	make sure to charge your laptop before coming on the weekends. They turn off the power to the outlets.

11315	11881	Definitely one of the best iced lattes I've had. And they were playing Led Zepplin, when I was there. What's not to like? :)

54459	11902	Gruyere w\/caremelized onions is amazing (& good brunch sandwich after a late night). Get it on the country bread.
229622	11902	Disappointing. Tuna was was salty, salad was prepackaged arugula and served in a plastic takeout container. Feels too cheap for the price they charge.
84797	11907	They closed down...and will be forever missed :(
82569	11909	Get the roasted carrots-  which are roasted in olive oil until they're caramelized and creamy, and then dressed with a bit of pomegranate molasses and a shower of cilantro.
72	11909	if you're feeling really hungry, get the potatoes and burnt ends on the side. the crispy bits, ooh, the crispy bits

49206	11930	Go to this shake shack because the line is MUCH MUCH faster, and your food is ready in a matter of minutes. Not the wait you would experience in madison square park.

16049	11930	Great place to have dinner after visiting The American Museum of Natural History
258693	11930	Don't worry if there's no seats upstairs, there's usually some down in the rec room and plenty of benches across the street, along W 77th st
150051	11930	So far it's the best burger I've had in the city. The line might be long, but it moves quickly. The deliciously seasoned burger meat is worth the wait anyway. Of course, the shakes are awesome, too.
36865	11930	The decision is very easy: Shack Burger. Best burger of any fast-burger chain in the nation.
5565	11930	Two lines. One for FOOD & DRINK. Another separate (shorter) line for DRINK ONLY.  Choose wisely.

11465	11930	Get the Shack Stack. Do it.
24230	11930	Shack Stack for the win! Shakes make good company. Hot dog variations, not so much of a win.
171647	11930	This location is frequently visited by people who eat hamburgers.
38897	11930	The line is so much faster than Mad Sq Park's! Go for the ShackBurger and don't forget your Cheese Fries! YUMMY! You won't easily forget! :)
55428	11934	The employees have no communication skills, you may have to order 3 times with 3 different people.  A joke. Worst Starbucks I've ever been to.
205591	11934	Always have awful experiences here. Sad because I work in this building
205591	11934	Avoid. Not quality drinks and the wait is ridiculous

129	11954	The line starts the opposite of where you think!
17620	11954	You will have no idea if the girls behind the counter are flirting with you or not.

113120	11987	I can't find a better latte anywhere else. They have the most amazing staff. Each and every one of them remember their customers and how they like their coffee.
51537	11989	Historical \
22056	11989	The $.95 after every price is a bit hilarious, I mean, glass of wine $13.95, feels a bit like Chilli's, but the club sandwich was amazing, even at $17.95.
82569	11990	These guys brought all sorts of tacos to Choice Eats and we loved everyone one of them. Mmm, tacos.
3266	11990	Best tacos down in SoHo! (via Scoville)
13095	11990	The meat is outstanding, so order the tacos without the onions. Raw and overbearing, they just don't do the meat any justice.

43388	12037	Love J-curry and one one does it as good as Curry-ya -- reminds me of Tokyo but lush. Sweet marble bar and I like how they serve curry in little cauldrons. Recommend the pork but everything's good.
14912	12042	If they aren't busy and you're pressed for time before you catch your train or bus, they're very accommodating in getting you in and out as quickly as possible. Incredibly friendly waitstaff!

25041	12047	Great tapas! Tight seating in the bar room.
7487	12047	Service was poor. Waitress kept us waiting even though restaurant was pretty empty. Asparagus was disappointing, croquettes were good but order only brings two. Overall it was forgettable.

154689	12049	Fresh, delicious oysters, served with bloody mary cocktail sauce.
104	12049	For a perfect 1-2 punch, have the pork belly appetizer and the skate entree. Both are amazing and make you forget about the slightly too cool for school attitude from the staff.

28925	12053	Unattentive service. Overpriced drinks. Just asked us for drinks and never came back to ask us what we wanted to eat so we left.
140970	12055	If you're looking for a great appetizer, try the crabcake. A must have is the \

43850	12150	Nice idea pairing cupcakes and wine. Ambience is a B- though.

30718	12159	Get there \
24230	12159	Originally located under the Manhattan Bridge and ended up here. Still continues to be the best place for Vietnamese sandwiches. Just remember it 'crose' Mondays and early when they sell out early.

20092	12214	Steve the manager is awesome. He knows how to keep the line moving and great at client interaction.

43905	12214	This place is HECTIC. Know your order before you step up or it'll be like world war 3...

62189	12215	Crumb cheesecake is great. Light and fluffy and not too sweet.

62189	12215	Red Velvet cake is great and moist, one slice is big enough to be sliced and shared for two or to go. Just request it.

139307	12231	The food here is really good and inexpensive. Been coming here for years.
196154	12231	One of the best places in manhattan for 5 dollar eats! Plenty of things to choose from.

61109	12252	carol singers!
4693	12268	So wait?!?! 20% Gratuity for three people?! WTF?!
46440	12269	They add 20% for parties of 4 or more automatically then provide terrible service. I guess they figure they can get away with it because of the fine print on their menu.
25121	12269	The AC is broken. Unbearable.
8388	12272	Try the Soul Burger with sweet potato fries

75177	12281	Very good vegetarian options. Nice atmosphere. Good service. Not great but above average..
88996	12281	Avoid at all costs. Go to a traditional Chinese place or a fake meat specialist restaurant if you're craving either. This place doesn't do justice to any. Plus it's a little pricey.

6728	12368	Original w\/ mochi, strawberry, and mango
22141	12368	Blood orange flavor with blood orange pieces!!
14912	12368	Get cheesecake bites as one of your toppings. It's not in one of the tins you see over the counter, so it's easy to miss the little sign for it.
199027	12374	Tunisian salad is a must for tuna lovers
6120	12374	So many options, but I loved the Egg Salad Sandwich!

82569	12468	Sick of sucky pre-packed sushi? Say thank-you to the Lobster Place. Their Sushi and Nigiri combo is the answer to your sushi-loving prayers!
793	12468	You can eat a fresh+cocked+big lobster here!. They cocked to you when you order and you can choose!. 2-3 lbs.\/piece * $12.50\/lbs.
57056	12476	Don't even get me started about how hot the male staff is! #nopunintended
2637	12476	Holy pigshit, Batman! Have the Duck Shwarma!!!
57056	12476	The Phoenician lemonade is good, but the From Beirut with Passion is HEAVEN!
943	12476	Service was excellent, the food was terrific.   It's pricey and very uber trendy... the place looks great, though.  Eat in the lounge to hack the line... just as nice, if not better than tables.
7395	12476	I recommend the warm eggplant dish, the gnocchi, and the snowball for dessert! Delicious!
104	12493	The pastrami hash (often a special) is one of the best brunches in the neighborhood.
104	12493	One of the best bistro-style burgers I've had in the neighborhood.
1317	12493	The aviation cocktail here is outstanding. I'm picky about them since they're one of my faves but, no matter who's behind the bar, they are stellar.
16602	12493	Grab a growler (or refill your own) w\/ one of the Sixpoint Craft Ales on tap.

13999	12493	The scrambled egg cheddar on a biscuit is amazing with or without sausage. If sweet is your angle the French toast is tops too.

36073	12493	Steak frites most delicious as a midnight snack, otherwise known as when the wait to get in is no longer epic.
6359	12493	Food is good but the service is TERRIBLE. Took over 2 hours to get through lunch.

16602	12493	Listed by @GQmagazine as one of the best Restaurant Cocktail Bars in the country!
14046	12494	while there's unlimited mimosas there's extremely limited waitstaff to bring them.  there is unlimited ass in my face as busboys pass my table due to the cramped condition.
31216	12494	During weekend brunch they offer unlimited mimosas and bloody marys. It's a little cozy inside but the food is well worth it!
64526	12494	I've never been during the day, but evenings have been great without exception.
48083	12495	No big changes from Campo to Il Cibreo.  Reliable for lunch w\/good lunch special menu.  One of the better options in Columbia area for lunch.

69614	12510	Get the Reuben Sandwich.  You will not be disappointed.  It's to die for! Best in Hoboken and better than Carnegie Deli.
60211	12510	salmon was a little bland but fries are delish & while some beers are $$, cider was only $5
93190	12510	Tried it after not liking the weekly menu at Amandas down the road. No regrets. Muscles and ponmes frites to die for. Dry rub prime rib and pallae special also fantastic totally coming back here!

242207	12542	Jenny is awesome love coming by to chat with her
27404	12543	One of Manhattan's best coffee spots in such a weird, nondescript locale. They have pourovers here, but more important to me is the cold-brew. Hard to find as good a cup of iced coffee.
23014	12543	Really, no fresh fruit?
237695	12552	always eat here when i'm doing laundry. turkey burgers are the best.

1088	12556	Try the lamb burger with goat cheese.
39879	12568	Go to Martha's.  Get yourself one of their pecan torts.  Like a little mini pecan pie but with a thick, crunchy solid crust and thick pecan layer that gives a wonderful chew.
222469	12568	The AS choice: Red Velvet cupcake, Kitchen Sink cookie, and a Black & White cupcake!
222469	12568	The \
4787	12568	Tripp is a fan if the giant chocolate chip cookie. They warm them up btw so they are extra gooey.
214268	12575	I really dig their organic vegetable omelets. Order counter service and sit up front for great people watching on Bedford. Warning: though it may seem tempting, the patio is ALWAYS too hot.
15397	12580	Sit in the back garden and order a bunch of pizzas. They are all amazing and better than anything else on the menu.
16255	12580	Great at 1pm when all other east village spots have long lines
193653	12584	Got here in the first day they offered a breakfast burrito! Score
92202	12598	LOUD. LOUD. LOUD. If you want to have overpriced Mexican in the most obnoxiously loud venue in the area, this is for you.
242835	12598	I didn't love it. The food was bland and lacked even an attempt  at authenticity.
72	12608	can't go wrong with lunch here. i almost always get the steamed dumplings and red curry pair
129	12608	The drunk man noodles are your friend.
33575	12612	Power UP with their coffee with a panini served on bread from Balthazar Bakery...2 registers are now line killers!
41875	12612	Come after the lunch rush, it's nice and quiet.
30502	12612	Ask for a side of bread if you get a salad. It comes from the delicious Balthazar Bakery!
82569	12617	We like the migas- a scramble of eggs with cheese, pico de gallo, red or green hot sauce, shredded cheddar, and leftover tortillas, usually fried into chips
50489	12617	The ice cream cart outside during the summer is very special.  I get the salted caramel pretzel. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
27404	12617	Delish panini's and other brunch items for super cheap, considering its all organic! Salted caramel ice cream is great too.
63353	12617	come with friends to share plates. Must try: candied bacon!
5021	12617	Get the kale and the potato hash
616	12621	If you order anything but the Fried Pork Chop for brunch, you're really missing out (okay, maybe the poached eggs too). Bloody Mary's (even the one with the oyster) are just so-so...
82569	12621	Try the brown butter, corn, and mushroom linguine-auced in a rich slurry of brown butter and corn milk, which pools at the bottom of the plate, where it's soaked up by feathery chanterelles.
104	12621	You haven't lived until you've had a katsu-style deep fried pork chop & cheddar waffle for breakfast.
42283	12621	The linguini w\/ peas, spring onion & garlic..amazing. Fresh & light with a kick of chilli, so good.
13999	12621	Brunch gets crowded quickly but if you're only 2 you might try a bar seat.
16602	12621	Enjoy a Sixpoint Bengali Tiger IPA. A rare find and a fantastic beer.
5009	12621	My favorite: make your partner order the pancakes (delicious), and you order the hash (best I've had). Split and enjoy.
58758	12621	The Classic Bloody Mary is probably the best I've had. Perfect amount of spice. Pickle Garnish too.
36073	12621	Free mimosa or bellini with your Sunday brunch, but not until after 12:00 pm. House rules.
2720	12621	Tasty scallops
43127	12621	Pecan Pie Sunday is out of control amazing. Bread pudding is right on the money.
43127	12621	Amazing & CRISPY fried chicken!! Linguine was so so.
82455	12621	Hard to have a bad meal here--but the banana bread pudding is a must--even if you don't have room.
37210	12621	Check Out The Chicken & Waffles!  You won't be sorry....
14324	12621	Try: sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes, duck meatloaf and their dark and stormy. You will not regret. Go to Mini Bar for a drink if there is a long wait for table; they'll call you when ready.
556	12621	At $11 with cheese, I think their burger is one of the best deals in the city. If you want a great vibe restaurant and don't want to spend $125 on dinner for two.. get the burger!
103216	12625	Pinwheels are great but the wings suck. Your better off hopping the F train to Bergen for Atomic Wings if u really want chicken.

52312	12636	Don't way the muffins unless ur a fan of larva
149253	12636	Staff nice, food great, but the pace of food service is unbearably slow
6236	12636	no laptop rule til 230pm; this for night owls who are just waking up
204517	12641	Two words: rice bowl. Light and delicious.
14046	12641	kick ass screwdrivers and blood orange mimosas!

197679	12700	Very busy during lunch hours, but the burgers are delicious and worth the wait.
86519	12700	Shakes are good, sandwiches are good. Just reminds me of a 5 Guys... Nothin special... There are better places with better selections in New York City than here... (1 of 4 petals via Fondu)
139930	12700	I like the Grilled 4 Cheese sandwich with bacon.
1342	12700	Don't overlook the hot dogs here. Perfectly grilled!

1664	12700	They changed the bathroom code, now it prints on your receipt.
62189	12700	Try the crispy chicken BBQ Club and a side of fries. Soooo Goood!
8251	12700	Mac and joe is awesome.
22938	12700	get the fresh market salad. it's plenty of food and it's so filling that you don't need to add any protein!

64805	12700	Sit in the kids seats
25948	12700	The regular size macaroni is big enough for two people. Have the side size for individual servings.
2839	12700	Chocolate peanut butter shake is very tasty, but not tasty enough for a 15 minute wait at that price (~$7.50)
73518	12719	This Starbucks is one of my favorites...

58	12735	They've currently got a deal running where you can get a three course dinner (app, entre, dessert) for 19 bucks Sunday through Thursday.
1296	12741	The truffle grilled cheese may have been inspired by a lascivious Chuck Bass scene in Gossip Girl, but it really is that good. Enjoy with a sidecar or glass of red wine.
8388	12741	Impressive, ornate, and romantic place to start or end a midtown NYC evening
8388	12741	Sadly Gilt is closed for the summer - come back in the fall!

27769	12790	Love the carne asada.  The wait is long...but worth it.
13501	12790	40 Minutes and waiting. Not good for a short lunch break
66854	12790	The line is super long during work week lunch. If you go either go really early or not o at all.
8952	12790	Order anything and you won't be disappointed. Seriously fresh and well made. It's a long wait but most things that are good take time.
11466	12790	The secret must be the flaky, toasted tortillas...
21605	12792	Wednesday Night is Trivia night and the Trivia is wonderfully obscure!
16049	12792	Four words: Lobster Mac and Cheese.

19732	12903	Really great drip coffee from direct trade blah blah blah. Basically this coffeshop signals the incredible decadence of our society. Love it therefore
8210	12903	Best coffee I've had.
86519	12903	They are serious about their coffee here!! Good thing too, cause I like it that way! Low key, free wifi, but don't order food--$10 for a simple sliced bread sandwich?!?\u2026 (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
149548	12903	When they have it, La Perla de Oaxaca (it's Mexican coffee) is incredible.
29301	12903	Any drink ordered here will be superbly prepared and delicious. Friendly service, the place has an excellent vibe!  It does get quite busy; enjoy a quieter setting downstairs. Dig the light fixtures.
68	12903	Say hello to my daughter while you're there.  This is her local haunt.  Quiet, pretty blonde reading a book.
54949	12903	Great coffee! Definitely mix it up. Get a cortado or macchiato...great coffee art from skilled baristas! Great vibe, but check out downstairs too for a chiller area.
43293	12906	You'll need to make some noise to keep your water glass full, but other than that Menkui Tei is a solid, happy Japanese restaurant with food that's ordinary in Japan but much appreciated stateside.
138382	12906	There are \

23853	12908	Try the lemonanana
66227	12908	The health sandwich is a great deal. Eggplant, salad, hummus, an egg. So tasty.

13095	12914	Chorizo burrito: get it. packed with guacamole and well-seasoned meat
38956	12914	The food is absolutely horrid. The service and margaritas are also really bad. The restaurant itself is nice and has wonderful patio. If you go, just don't eat...
13999	12927	The best coffee in the hood (D'Amico BBTP blend) and perfect coffee lids (most of the time)!
206777	12927	It's all about the French toast bagel.
187044	12927	The breakfast wraps are good but the bagels are lame.

1404	12989	It's OK that you've never heard of Il Porto, because it hasn't been around forever. But if you want some of the best pizza NYC has to offer be sure to stop here -- it's cheap.
6359	12989	Pizza is pretty good, but skip the desserts. Worst cannoli I've ever had.
72	12991	after a long ride, try something simple like their take on a lemonade: purified water, lemon juice, agave. i tried the heavier combinations and i just couldn't take it (need to get used to the tastes)
1296	12991	The Peaches and Dreams smoothie with an added liver detox boost will zap away your hangover like fairy dust!
13880	12991	The Grasshopper is a perfect post workout refresher... Spend the extra 50cent for the large drink, its worth it.
178067	12991	Friendliest staff in all of NYC. Pressed juices are the way to go. Not cheap.

147338	13028	do strawberry yogurt w\/ ny chz cake bites yummyyy
122123	13028	euro tart is def the best flavor for those who still want the yogurt\/tart consistency and the the creaminess of red mango or pinkberry.
29320	13028	If you here on November 15th-mention \
65308	13028	The birthday cake flavor is to die for!
2772	13033	new favorite restaurant in williamsburg

19066	13047	great drinks, but it's a pretty small place

82569	13074	Try the Fried Ipswich clams-a pile of the fat clams, fried in a light, crisp cracker coating. Tartar sauce with chopped pickles comes on the side, but you hardly need it
19732	13074	Ed's Lobster Bar concept expands to it's third location on one of the best eating blocks in the city. Clean. Fresh. Inviting. Impeccable food. Order anything. Be happy.

191	13074	make sure you try fried oyster sliders, Ed recommended them

82113	13209	Nice if Jamba offered rice or almond milk for those of us who avoid soy.
4787	13209	I think they have jumped the shark. The whole franchise has really let itself go. I miss 2000 when they were immaculate, high quality and moderately priced.

5009	13233	No bells & whistles\u2014just fantastic coffee.

42214	13245	Check out NYC's only Chick-fil-A. It's inside a dorm but open to the public. Go straight in until you hit the food court, then turn right. If you reach the kosher area you've gone too far!

230811	15862	What happened to the service? It's gotten ridiculously terrible!
173878	15862	My favorite chili relleno in the city!  Ask if the limoncello ginger margarita is one of the day's specials - it's a great way to start OR end your meal.
65695	15862	Very mediocre food.
19408	15876	surprisingly good lunch in midtown
207922	15892	I'd much rather eat here than the overrated, overpriced Carnegie Deli nearby. The staff here at Park Cafe are warm and down to earth. I feel like I'm with family here.
51971	15900	This has been one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken for a while. ALWAYS get the guacamole & order the Tijuana combo if you want to try a few things. Delish & great spot to take out of towners!
52206	15900	They catered a party I went to... Had no idea it was an option! Def. catering my next event!!!
5833	15901	Get the guacamole. Incredible.

17949	15930	Wednesday is Wingsday
42214	15936	You can use any cash register to pay for your order. Besides the popular one by the salads there's also one around the corner by the baked goods and one by the juice bar.
104634	15936	Do NOT get a salad here if you're concerned about cross-contamination. Meat was flying everywhere and was landing in the vegetables. Who knows what else.

69836	15936	Awesome breakfast!
6360	15944	Small servings. It's ok but too pricey.

27697	15960	They make the best skinny vanilla lates!

48016	16079	The Lingonberry Margaritas and Swedish Meatballs are amazing! (Eat them with Lingonberry and Cloudberry sauce...YUMMO!)

205941	16119	The curry rice that comes with the ramen set is really good!

118710	16148	Everything here is fantastic but you must try the croquetas, Calamares (fried squid rings in paprika aioli) and the tortilla is splendid. Of course their gambas al ajillio is spot on too :)

41955	16167	The oyako-don is good and cheap - both at the same time.

58	16264	The Gang Phed Ped Yang delicious. I pretty much order it every time I'm here.
53489	16297	Do not get the Enchiladas. Not worth $13. Maybe worth $5.

6035	16350	The cajun sandwich is great!

12521	16364	If you want a decent beer, get a Chimay, a true Belgian Trappist.

82569	16368	We went back to Grandaisy Bakery and loved the pecorino pizza blanca -- not quite bread, not quite pizza, but totally delicious!
16170	16368	The Bianca is the best deal for a unique pizza slice you'll get in the city. Try the Pecorino Bianca as well
29831	16368	Not a single bad thing to say about this place + it's food.
63432	16368	Good food but the pomodoro pizza was disappointing.
17435	16377	it's all about the buffalo chicken wings here.. plus there's the added bonus of outdoor eating and seating.
61388	16377	At lunch sometimes off menu is a grilled vegetable on focaccia sandwich with spectacular pesto melted mozzarella fresh basil and grilled tomatoes. Go for it. A winner in the house of beef and seafood.
5183	16378	Ask for the Paul Kuhn special...they'll know what you mean
5663	16403	The chive pancakes are KILLER! They're so good and popular that the restaurant often runs out of them early.

118710	16437	Tapas in Midtown? Awesome! Meat tapas can be small but nonetheless tasty and be sure to get the Patatas Bravas with fried duck egg as a side. Estrella Damm or a nice Rioja finishes the job

50489	16439	Secret phone number required for reservations.  Continental cuisine as interpreted by Japanese chefs.  Located in the old studio of Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Delicious food. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
11075	16439	nigori + veggie fondue (presentation is gorgeous). rice balls are yummy too.
63386	16439	Pan roasted branzino was my fav! Drinks are amazing! Vibe feels like your coolest friend's apt. One of my fav meals ever!

17435	16466	it's a special occasion destination in the city for the bronx ricans.. if that's your scene, pair it with pernil and\/or the sazon paella.

28925	17698	If the line is too long go to the stand across the street. Same company same taste! It's a pyschological thing why the one cart has a longer line than the other. :P

69836	21831	The old-fashioned pizza is amazing!
25	21833	Great place, but a few items fall short. Stuffed mushrooms lack a variety of flavors and, even though not fried, are sitting in a pool of oil.
23487	21833	The food is ok but the servers are Yummi - wink*-
98314	21833	All around bad time. Looks were deceiving. Food and service was awful. We waited for like 10 min before anyone noticed we wanted to be seated, there was no host. Stuffed mushrooms were freezer burnt.
83311	21841	Really good pizza in the city with a really cool wood fire oven behind the bar.
78275	21841	Strawberry lemonade is sweet but rocks the house. If you want bread, you have to ask for it, it's their policy.

1317	22158	If you're here for dinner, you can ask to be seated in the wine cellar downstairs. !!

31686	22218	Ordering online means nothing here apparently #fail
39957	22218	Steak was too spicy for me, and I've loved the steak at other Chipotle places. Won't stop me from coming back, though. A little pricey, but what can you do? It's SoHo.

33560	22366	Bloody Mary is great!!
18885	22366	save room for dessert - the chocolate pudding is AMAZING
16035	22366	doesn't recommend waiting in the lounge adjacent to hotel lobby. It's dark and secluded. Best suited for couples wanting privacy as they decide between his place, hers or getting a room.
16035	22366	highly recommends the lobster stew. It's a little bit messy but well worth the experience.
90814	22424	Great bagels!!! I've even become a huge fan of whole wheat everything!!!!

57971	22444	Pass on the Salty Pimp, get the CocoCone! So delicious!
12916	22463	sesame pancake sandwiches are fantastic. can't fail with the dumplings either.
49805	22463	The frozen dumplings (under $10 for a pack of 30) are so worth it - both affordable and DIY!

139232	22519	this place is bomb. order the falafel with everything.

24672	22596	Word to the wise: ask them to crack the lobster lest you want to get sprayed in the face.

59867	22715	Excellent thin crust pizza. Highly recommend the meat lover's pie.
49177	22722	Do yourself a favor and do not get the hot wings. Your mouth will be burning for a long time
48276	22722	Garlic Wings tasted like or better yet was smothered in balsamic vinegrette tasting sauce.  No garlic taste what so ever.  Chipotle wings much better!
83935	22722	I have finally discovered good salsa above the Mason-Dixon! It is here and it is green...get it.
39105	22722	The service is pretty bad and there are speakers where there should be TVs but the torta el diablo aint bad
22293	22732	Go was my favorite place to go for affordable, but GOOD Japanese food AND sushi. This place closed in March or April 2011 and I still miss it :(

1627	22769	Don't check the health records before stopping in. Trust me.

64600	22805	Lamb and veg pie. And a sausage roll. Brings me back to my old tuck shop of high school days.
211609	22812	One of the better meals I have eaten. An all around stunner from the quaint restaurant to the perfectly prepared food. I am tempted to stop in for a glass of wine and the Tabla de Embutidos y Queso ev

27297	22821	BBQ chicken burrito, wheat tortilla, brown rice. Yum!
59679	22821	I was not pleased both times I've been here. Why is good Mexican food so hard to find on the east coast
27297	22821	Avoid the guacamole -- bland -- but do try the chicken soup when they actually have it.
23909	22821	Food is good but the service is poor. From an outsiders prospective it looks like they need a manager.
26759	22859	No seasonal fruit in the winter...
9148	22859	Don't get fufu coffee it is 75% foam
29301	22859	Order the Berry White Hot Chocolate if you're in the mood for liquid Lucky Charms!

1731	23049	The Greek burger is a surprise favorite for me. The intermingling of the feta, beef & black olives form a unique flavor combination that hits you on the first bite and hits harder on the second bite.
49805	23055	Roasted garlic and onion knish is OUT OF THIS WORLD good.
50489	23055	If you like a Knish, this is the best place to go.  Get the kasha Knish or the original. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

9962	23119	First place I've come across that has liquid brown sugar 4 ur iced coffee 2 thumbs up.

56171	28415	A Great cappuccino but at 4.50 it's a bit much especially if you have had any of the new coffee shop's cappuccinos. Like Stumptown, Gimme Coffee or even Joe's. They are all better and less &$&
57581	28427	I've never felt so unwelcomed at a Thai Restaurant before.  Plus brown rice costs an extra $2???

168813	28783	If bland and dry cupcakes are your thing, look no further.
18213	28783	I am truly addicted to the cookies here. Typically, the better decorated cookies look, the worst they taste. Eleni's actually are delicious.
46026	28788	While noodles are the thing here, they make great boiled dumplings if you are willing to wait.
43127	28788	This place is awesome. Stop thinking about going & just go! Take a peek in the kitchen to see a noodle master at work.

29177	29670	Delish tofu soups, best in Ktown

178106	30525	must try the pork belly, simply amazing!
196154	30525	Definitely worth it if you are out and about late night and looking for a place to eat and drink. Love the skewers, the noodles, ramen, and bangin selection of sake.

104	30652	I highly recommend going double porky: start with the pork belly tacos (homemade tortillas + guacamole are slamming) and end with the Heritage pork. Oink!

49161	30863	This place is a DISASTER! Keep walking up Bway, there's a better 'bucks thataway.

4697	30926	Not every Ramen is $6.50 on Mon, but I still loved my warming Mabu Ramen on the first nasty day of winter. Perfectly delicious!
193062	30926	Nothing particularly special but pretty damn good, good deal.
51939	30941	Order a mini version of every dessert and you'll have a lovely little dessert sampler!
261897	30941	I like the fruit tarts -- I take some home whenever I visit NY. My friends like the cheesecake and I would have to agree with them!
34119	30941	They have really good Italian ices, and a large is only $2.50. I've found my go-to summer treat.

42214	31052	Use the hidden cash register opposite the panini grills. It's cash-only but will save you some time.

131334	31164	Get an appetizer and half portioned donburi for a complete meal...
22056	31164	The katsu don was pretty good. For $12 I guess I can't complain. Large beers are steins, not pints.

15440	31167	Best naan bread. Mushroom saag amazing. Well priced and equally good valued wine list.

60682	31453	Borderline shady seating scene upstairs, but decent.

27404	31671	Make sure to get the Jalapeño Bottle Caps. Yum.
43127	31671	Pulled chicken isn't pulled. It's more like diced.
7599	31671	If you have a hankering for a pulled pork sandwich, look elsewhere.
6344	31671	Try the cornbread. Incredible. Best I've ever had.
87042	31672	I have eaten at countless sushi places around NYC, this place is amazing for not only price and quality, but quantity and attentive staff! I will defiantly be back.

152611	31822	Sabrina nailed it on the head, get the burger \
26168	31853	I think Starbucks policy with regard to ice water is, from a business perspective (not to mention a psychological one), pathetic.
6318	31853	If you are looking to camp out and get some work done, keep walking! They covered most if not all of the outlets!
11527	31853	The lines grow and shrink based on when the inter-city busses are picking up. There's not much you can do but come early and hope you catch a break. The upstairs is nice for waiting on a bus though.
38431	31853	Good for meetings if you don't need your laptop (all of the power outlets are covered). There's an upstairs area with more seating that's usually relatively empty.
230805	31853	Closed outletts. Stupid seating arrangement.

5663	31973	My favorite vegetarian dish is #16 Tsel Gyathuk Ngopa, which is sauteed noodles mixed with fresh green vegetables and tofu. Make sure you add the chili sauce that you get on the side.
43293	31973	Has to be one of the best deals in town. Get any of the soups for a hearty and heart-warming appetizer. Everything I've had is delicious!
143431	31973	Amazing food! And BYOB!
57736	31973	Dumplings and spicy sauce...the best!!!

11372	32582	Love the bison cheesesteak wrap. Try the turkey meatloaf.
1296	32586	The fish and chips here must have come from some kind of prehistoric sea creature. It's huge. Way too big for one person to finish unless you are the Hulk.
52312	32586	Try the Welsh Rarebit - its the most heavenly open faced grilled cheese ever - also skip the apple berry crumble, too saucy
184931	32586	They will deep-fry anything you bring.  Anything.

25787	32603	order a pitch of white\/red sangria and they will make the drink in front of you
66854	32603	The Sangria is amazing. It's quite expensive, but definitely worth it if you're looking for an awesome drink. They even make it right in front of you.

105569	32765	The grilled chicken breast + chipotle mayo is a good choice.
22056	32765	Look, the sandwiches are fine. But this is NYC. Nit exactly hard to find a good sanger. So forget the sandwiches and focus on their chocolate croissant. Focus.... And buy. Just superb.
87167	32765	Lobster bisque are heavenly. And free potato chips!
42214	32770	An entirely different pizza experience than you get used to in Brooklyn. At least a dozen different pizzas to choose from at any time. One slice is a meal unless you're the really hungry type.

43854	33743	The iced cap with choc shavings.... The Broc salad and the sizzling duck crepe- 4 uber yum rating

12246	35260	Great coffee (get the large cappuccino!), greater Stevie Wonder soundtrack.
49805	35260	Prosciutto sandwich is sinfully delicious.

80608	35833	it gets crowded here quickly (max 20ish people can fit) come at off peak hours
195207	35833	Don't be fooled. You might want to order 10 of these little burgers but 3-4 is all I can eat. They must be the best in the whole state.
51468	35833	Double cheese with onions and pickles is the way to go! No lettuce or tomatoes allowed!
36865	35833	Chocolate shake was good. Friend said the double is better than a single. Jerry Seinfeld ate here. And it's #13 on GQ's 20 burgers to eat before you die.
71211	35833	All you need is singles with cheese and onion. Steak and cheese takes up too much stomach space. Save all your room for sliders, you won't regret it.

138699	37586	So the service here is not great, the servers are too busy playing amongst themselves and not focusing on customers. They only care when it comes to the tip.

17238	38689	Sometimes ordering from their sides menu and making it your order is just as good. Yum leave here happy. Everything they have waffle is great!
154689	38689	Whole fish, thanksgiving style. Better than it sounds. A lot.
154689	38689	Don't miss the crab bisque with duck confit. Incredible.
1317	38689	Tempura soft boiled egg and the tofu entree. Get it. Or the grits for brunch.
16498	38693	Bird's Nest is delicious.
52025	38752	The best breakfast in the area, can't go wrong ;-)
616	38753	You can't go wrong with the sample platter, but go for the meat & potato dumplings too.  Maybe order an extra side of kielbasa.
22575	38753	Don't order the vegetable soup its just a potato in a cup
29949	38753	Best chicken noodle soup on the island. Overall better eats than gentrified veselka up the street.
4463	38775	Wow bad service and poor food. Stay away.
17141	38916	Great sandwich menu.
40736	38916	Amazing sandwiches with fresh Italian meats and homemade mozzarella for only $7!
29123	38920	Um, grilled cheese sandwiches should not be open-faced. Or have lettuce. Also, tuna melts should be melted. Also, boneless buffalo wings should have buffalo sauce on them.
109481	38920	If you order the French Dip, get extra jus... They give you a tiny cup of it.
27367	38929	Carbonara is made right.wud add more pepper,but not Alfredo sauce.egg,cheese,pasta water.fried mozz is 3 stix w sauce not the mozzarella in carrozza waiter said it wud be. (2 of 4 petals via Fondu)
114319	38932	Try the food some great options and recent additions like dulce de leche treats are great ! Cozy neighborhood coffee shop!
82569	39072	They brought Sausage (Christian Style), Vareniki with Sour Cherries, Vareniki with Potato, Baked Eggplant Saute \
237070	39104	I would skip this one - great atmosphere but very mediocre food. Not what you'd expect in Little Italy.
38456	39104	the pizza is so industrial. starting with the crust (which isnt crispy at all), continuing with the sauce (tastes like it was taken from a can at the grocery store) and finish with mediocre cheese.
13999	39120	Order via app or online to beat the long lunch lines and go straight to the register to pick up your order.
25094	39120	I love Chipotle. This one is as good as the others but pretty busy\/long lines with lots of tourists (no surprise given the location). (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

21442	39120	If you're getting food here, go for the Tacos or the Bowls. Their rice and beans are nothing special, so the best strategy is to load up on sour cream and meat.
27404	39120	This place is always too busy. You should be getting creative anyway and trying out the Koreatown digs on 32nd st. or at least nommy Heartland Brewery next door (with more time, of course.)
59619	39230	Ask for a punch card if u don't already have one! Great cafe latte.
23420	39230	I had the most sublime Cafe Latte here.  May be the best I've had in NYC.
7599	39230	Chai is... decent. Get the coffee, much better.
43905	39230	Good espresso, but not the most inviting or comfy venue. Best to take away, I think.
38448	39230	Iced coffee is disgusting. They pour hot coffee over ice. So it taste watery and like melted plastic.
34625	39230	All their regular drip coffee is awesome
13324	39230	They manage do draw hearts in coffee but they don't have wifi and can't do a good hot chocolate
25651	39242	My god it's the perfect latte.
1317	39242	The attractive baristas and baristos (?) here keep the line moving & put a pep in your step with the super charged coffee. The latte designs = bonus.
49206	39242	take your coffee into the lounge! it's amazing.
10760	39242	Probably the best coffee in New York - keep on going back there. The hipster outfits are a bit of a turnoff tho - Portland one takes itself a little less seriously.
82569	39242	Winner of Best New Coffeehouse in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Grab yourself one of their bottled iced coffees and plant yourself in the hotel lobby.
36073	39242	Their hipster-barista uniforms are as embarrassing as the coffee is delicious!
16654	39242	The coffee is worth the wait. The mocha kicks ass.
49206	39242	The caramelized french toast. Can't go wrong with any choice here. Make sure to go to the lobby to find a place to sit. Tons of chairs and couches. Free wifi code at the front desk.

1090	39242	An opium den for hipster coffee addicts.
63433	39242	Ask what's on the secret podge menu. If they ask where you found that, deny deny deny 4square. ?
199027	39242	Wifi blows
27404	39242	This place always has a line for a reason: the people of Portland know what they're doing with their beans. Come at a slower time and enjoy your java in the Ace Hotel lobby with a good book.
49206	39242	get a coffee and relax.
5009	39242	They pull two shots for all sizes, so keep to the small latte unless you want to order extra shots in the medium or large!
65514	39242	Blueberry creame cookie. It is like eating cookie dough! Amazing
78275	39242	Charming staff and the cappuccino is a little drop of heaven, (emphasis on 'little', cup is mini size)!
29177	39242	the only coffee that wakes me up
12194	39242	Get a seat with an outlet and charge your phone\/laptop. There are outlets along the wall to the left - not only at the table in the middle. And yes, they do make the perfect latte.

48071	39253	Orange and carrots smoothie is the bomb!
116122	39261	A mostly new staff took over in Fall '10. Unlike the old staff, they're friendly and not jaded by the service industry. Get 'em while they're hot!
116122	39261	Mario makes the best double chocolate chip frappuccino if coffee isn't your thing.
116122	39261	There's a secret menu. Try the Oreo frappucino (white mocha syrup and regular mocha syrup in a regular double chocolate chip frap)
116122	39261	If Carly makes your double chocolate chip frap, ask for an extra pump of chocolate. She has a light hand when it comes to chocolate syrup.

32738	39416	Try dinner -- most people I know go for brunch, but I think the dinner menu is even more interesting.
47859	39416	Another great farm to table restaurant in Park Slope. Be adventurous here. Everything is delicious.
104	39416	The Hangtown Fry consists of eggs, Vermont cheddar, bacon and tempura-fried oysters. That's right. Oysters.   Breakfast re-imagined. Recognize.

152611	41961	True italian pizza, just like the old country
238035	42059	Mr Greengenes and Tropical Mangosteen are faves and the Acai bowls are a nice alternative to a salad lunch. Do the 3 day Cooler Cleanse if you're looking to detox. It's yummy and filling!

8210	42728	Really tiny inside, but the lobster mac was uh-may-zing.
29831	42728	Good, but smac is better IMO
8210	42728	Better than Smac if you ask me. Mac Lobsta is bomb.
249461	42728	The mac at Southern Hospitality is bigger. This tastes better though.
46450	42775	The Cadillac burger is indeed the Cadillac of burgers
148837	42775	Crab cakes are incredible. Alone, on the salad, on the sandwich - doesn't matter how you get them. Just get them.
10675	42775	Classic burger. No frills. Worth braving a few tourists and a less bro-heavy ambiance than 3rd ave. bartenders downstairs are fabulous.
27297	42775	If you are seeing a show at Lincoln Center, try grabbing a burger here. And make room for the cobbler.
66089	42775	Brussel Sprouts to die for!!   really...
10675	42775	I'm shocked at the number of bad tips here. This is false. Yes, it gets crowded and the service can get overwhelmed, but that's par for the course with any famous NYC jaunt. Come on a quiet night.
27297	42775	Amazing Apple Cobbler.
13259	42945	Yummy hot cocoa... get it with whip!
139190	43005	No outlets, slow service, $$ beer (even for an airport), ok food.  Prob best option for seated\/table service but that's not saying much.
42214	43005	Once you're past security in Concourse D this is the place to go. The beer is decently priced and the bar food is good. Try the chicken fingers.
8051	43052	Grab a spot by the window if you're lunching solo, and people watch along 8th street. Great location, staff is fast and cheerful.
25094	43052	Carnitas burro w pinto beans!
63432	43052	I love chipotle but this specific location is terrible. They're rude, inflexible, and food seemed old.
13693	43164	better coffee than the horton's next door
67859	43192	Also always ask to sit in the garden and snag one of the curtained cabanas--sooooo cozy in the winter and cool and relaxing in the summer--it's a great escape for lunch or dinner!
50869	43192	Curry chicken is slammin
199027	43192	Papaya is virtually calorie-free. Eat as much as you want - Asian proverb.

263465	43226	The salmon is to die for as is the bread and the veggie loaf!
26013	43226	Creative organic and free-range menu. The filet mignon will melt in your mouth. I love Josie's.
70881	43333	Breakfast sandwiches are good but Absolute Bagels are much better.
72723	43357	Bring a flashlight to read the menu at night
174167	43357	Ask for hummus when they seat you.  They used to serve it to everyone, but now they only do upon request.  It's free and yummy!
223740	43357	short ribs (sandwich & entree) are both superb.

51971	43453	Very friendly staff & super yummy wraps! I've formed an addiction to this place...
122027	43469	The worst service ever!! Please go any other at same street!
69036	43469	Food is hardly decent. Note to waiters: don't get mad if you get undertipped after billing gratuity on 5 ppl when you're providing minimal service ALONG with a nasty attitude.
122027	43469	Menu 10 euros pasta or pizza and drink... But pizza cold and too much cheese (bad quality) and poor ingredients. Sorry , novella is a bad election
135368	43480	Another 'tip' Two boots sucks!
82569	43579	Captain's Daughter: first and foremost a sardine sandwich. It uses an entire tin of the little fish, burying them underneath a pile of scallions, pickled eggs, capers, and the aforementioned herb
44483	43579	You can order any sandwich on the menu and you won't be disappointed
181505	43617	Chicken lollipop, blood sausage, and the curry are good!
50489	43617	If you really want an ethnic joint this place is perfect.  Himalayan live music paired with surprisingly tender yak.  Delicious! (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
50869	43795	Wish you had some couches or at least some comfy chairs or pillows or something
231211	43795	Get an iced coffee or hot latte. The pastries are from Balthazar and their croissants are like none other
9171	43795	They told me the put two shots of espresso in every cappuccino no matter what the size. If you need an extra kick, ask them to add a third. It's my standard there.

59959	43824	<3 the staff & food

8466	43879	Beware, 9oz. is a lot of, um, meat.
215956	44065	Not a huge fan of this one. They're usually out of something, but the venue's pretty good.
82569	44078	The Village Voice voted this Best Brooklyn Tavern in our Best Of New York Poll!
14964	44078	Grab a seat at the bar so you can watch the mixologists working their magic. The drinks are spendy at $10 or $11 each, but you're paying for artistry -- things like muddled lemon and candied ginger.
16602	44078	Stop in for a Bloody Henry.
50489	44078	I love this place because it does not have the annoying pretense of a swanky cocktail lounge.  It is a solid place with great drinks.  Grab a drink here after a meal at\u2026 (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
184931	44078	Beecher's Tonic + Turkey leg sandwich + sweet potato mash = YUM

126441	44192	Definitely try out the dessert crepes... well they're all good, but I especially love the Nutella with bananas one
4787	44217	The shrimp spring rolls are just insane. Get them or the Vietnamese Ravioli. You will not be sorry.
4787	44217	You can't go wrong here. There is no bad choices IMHO. Definitely definitely definitely get dessert. You'll be sorry if you don't.
27783	44217	I know tom yum is to thai as wonton  is to chinese but damn, they make it well here! Nice variety of shrooms with bite and normally the shrimp is part of the soup stock. In this case, very flavorful!
4787	44217	The Jap Chae and Bul Go Gui are maybe the best I have ever had. Please don't tell my mother-in-law :-)
4787	44217	All of the desserts here are just ridiculous. Fried banana or the coconut cake are my preferred way to end the evening.
4787	44217	The Neua Kra Prow is for you - if you like spicy beef with vegetables. I get it almost every time.
4787	44217	Get. The. Bulgogi.

11315	51231	The pork buns are everything you could hope for. Nom!
25807	51231	If you new to wait for a table make sure you're really hungry because the waitress will tell you to wait in the back in the milk bar. I dare you to try and resist milk and dessert. Try.
29415	51231	Enjoy the juicy, tender pork shoulder - ordered two weeks in advance. The only way to do it: 20 lettuce wraps, 15 oysters, seven hungry souls, five dipping sauces, a few grains of rice, one full girl.

57056	51302	Not Dominican? Be prepared to wait 5 min before anyone even makes eye contact. Even as a regular. Food: 8.5. Service: 3.
30961	51304	Tomato cheddar gets me every time! So good.
27783	51385	Weak sake knowledge. Asked about a particular one and was told, \
211609	51385	Dang! This place was great. We had been hankering for some really good Asian food for a while and Tanuki Tavern didn\u2019t disappoint in the least.
59612	51391	Unless your vegetarian, get the steak chili. Even then, I'd probably still recommend it.  It's that good.
17228	51419	It's closed. There's another one on 34th and 7th but they're much more expensive.
93393	51419	A little crammed
199142	51419	helthy food, good prices... and, it's at 5th Av!!!

52256	51770	Try the Cuban Sandwich - Pressed sandwich with glorious amounts of meat and cheese!  (via @Foodspotting)
25807	51776	Don't get the salt bagel. The salt isn't plentiful or substantial enough. Compare to Murray's Bagels. Seriously. Pair with strawberry cream cheese. Salty & sweet!
15416	51813	Great spot to loiter with a cappuchino. Starbucks is jealous.
154689	51911	The shrimp biryani and saag paneer is outstanding.

171647	52287	They serve hamburgers here, as well as french fries, chicken nuggets, and some other stuff.

135804	52387	Go for happy hour
131041	52582	Love the bagels and the muffins!

90894	52719	Dozens of school kids stream in here on their early lunch breaks. They behave well, but table space an issue

58220	53029	Go to the bar behind the curtains and say hi to Kuma San. Check out his visiting card !

207248	53085	When you come here you gotta ask for Lindsay as a waitress,she's a hoot!
238676	53169	Really expensive. $6 for a bagel with cream cheese. Cheesecake is good but Junior's is the best.
151828	53184	A whole new menu! Also check out their specials menu!
17435	53184	the ratio of yellows to whites is 4:1 which means this is 1 of the better ramen joints in yuppie central. stick to a tonkatsu ramen & add toppings. if it's a really cold day, oden is your dish.
72921	53213	They don't know how to cook a simple steak. Never again!
132611	53213	Service is very slow and prices are double what they are at other T.G.I Friday's. Not good over all.
43544	53213	Chicken fingers were brought out literally 5 mins after I ordered. Were prob sat under a heater and were cold minutes into the meal. :( fries were horrible go next door to mcdonalds
221886	53213	Worst service ever. Food took so long, wrong order, no refills plus bad attitude
13384	53300	Always, always, always come here for the flan. There's none like it. Thick and creamy, big slice.
19387	53346	Service is a little sketchy especially when it gets really busy
40332	53814	Get the brownie melt ..?
45015	53814	I sometimes feel the experience here Is hit or miss and the service is too slow

40332	54011	Honestly best Starbucks in NYC
20711	54011	The SB closest to the Worldwide Plaza courtyard is faster & makes better drinks.
72170	54032	Mediocre service, OK food... And they added their own hefty tip. Plus: smoky, no ventilation. Will not return.
197679	54032	An authentic cafe.  No chain or franchise by an means.  But that also means while the food is good, it's a little on the expensive side.
13999	54044	Order online or via app to skip the insane lunch line.
13999	54044	VIP tip: Order online or via app to completely skip the insanely long lunch line and pick your order up directly at the register.
82146	54085	Salad here is great
256434	54085	Large soup costs more than a round trip subway ride to Brooklyn.
19335	56006	With a million sandwich options, let me make it easy for you: turkey and Brie. So, so good!
132803	56006	Discount on soups if you work in the building. Always mobbed in there.

46494	56548	Just read from the window that almost half their menu is vegan! Need to get back in here.
118746	56577	Start with the country style green bean sheet jelly. Sounds strange, but it's really just a poorly named, but delicious hand-cut cold noodle dish. Perfectly seasoned!
63524	56577	i don't think you're ready for this jelly
82569	56596	Love the bar snacks, like sour sausage offered w\/ basil, mint, peanuts, and pickled veggies.
23420	56624	A perfect meal is the eggplant parm with linguini cooked with garlic and olive oil, and a glass of the house red.  It's relatively inexpensive too.  Great place to bring a date.
207922	56898	My Italian ex-lover Giuliano lives right by here. I miss him and our coffee runs so much! Maybe we'll cross paths here and rekindle that summer 2010 passion someday. *sigh*
35165	57043	Did this...Fried fish and sweet plantains...

3744	57281	Try the French Toast (via @Foodspotting)
24436	57322	Danny, the cute ex-hockey player turned bartender, no longer works here. Don't embarrass yourself by asking about him.

146467	57328	Worst Starbucks for seating!
239400	57328	Seams that cashier doesn't like tourists!
117321	57381	Worst service ever cashier was a rude snob
29949	57381	This place is legit. Texas wrap with mashed potatoes plus smoothie. Do it.
65876	57404	Visit #occupywallstreet and bring a few people some warm drinks, it'd getting cold and they are fighting so we can afford to keep shopping here.
13902	57404	Only one restroom.
36245	57674	thought this place was overpriced, plus they charged a $10 minimum for card use (one of my pet peeves, especially at an upscale cafe). devon & blakely down the street is much better value AND quality
21380	57674	be sure to try the cookies, hands down the best in the biz and also try one of their delicious crepe sanwich
21380	57674	best place to get coffee in the area and the two lovely ladies tending service are always a pleasure to chat with, this talk of Devon & whatever sounds like some paid sponsorship...
5748	57887	Alot an extra 20min for the sloooow service! So slow, pick it up.
1894	57918	$2.50 camembert? This is my jam.
211794	58085	Do not leave with out taking a rummy rum cake with you.. also strawberry wine Mercadel is divine.
259692	58389	Just when you think you can't get nothing to eat there is places like this that can help you with your hunger :-D
106704	58432	#1 Special, spicy is usually ready to go
42683	58494	Wish they would install a webcam so you could check the lines on rufus
82569	58893	Don\u2019t burn your tongue while tasting their Mallawah Press Toast \u2013 a yummy combo of sliced egg, sharp olives, Swiss cheese, and hot pepper sauce.
25094	58893	Is there such a thing as a bad crepe stand? (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
261848	58893	Get the original with milk chocolate instead of nutella. The bomb
135804	58906	The last time I went the service was crappy but overall the food is great
114319	58906	Have the crab cake at least once ! :)
114319	58906	The outdoor seating area is truly a hidden gem.
54251	58944	We love this restaurant.  Risotta. Was great, ravioli even better
54251	58944	Love this place, so romantic, and really good food too
72667	59059	The $10 credit card minimum is a little annoying with all their lunch specials under $10
39231	59059	The pad key Mao is yummy!
29949	59566	They have a $10k clover. Get a coffee made with this magical machine.

87196	59804	Crowded !!!!!
84552	59804	Call ahead of time and put your name on the list! Sometimes the wait is ridiculous!
82569	60031	Inspired by the regional Mexican cooking of Chicago's Rick Bayless, Cascabel is filled with scrumptious surprises, from the taco stuffed with homemade chorizo to the massive chile-braised beef rib.
26729	60031	No mention of the fish tacos???  Frigging awesome. And you are what you eat, which is why I'm awesome.
68798	60031	The mild guacamole is just that - good, but very mild. However, the Medium guac practically burned my mouth off! My advice: get the Mild with a side of jalepenos so you can adjust the spice yourself.
63386	60031	Cucumber margarita rocks! Yummy tacos! Finally a decent place on UES!
216886	60031	Right around the corner from my apartment - been here a few times for margaritas, beer, tacos & grilled corn. Nice atmosphere, food is good but a little pricy for what it is (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
89566	60031	Great baja fish tacos. Carnitas was mediocre. Heard the chicken was bomb too. Some good beers and solid drinks. Try El Capitan, stay away from pomegranate hibiscus margarita. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
195601	60031	Great UES spot - Guac & Saturday Tilapia special was delish. Cucumber & Cilantro marg was a little weak.
48639	60031	Try the cucumber or watermelon margaritas. Yummy and refreshing!
193062	60031	Had one of the egg dishes, was pretty awesome.
107013	60031	Vegetarians be advised, the beans are cooked with pork fat.
106855	60120	Same empanadas as Empanada Mama in Hell's Kitchen but at a fraction of the price!
222355	60120	So far, the best empanadas I tried in NY (not as good as in Argentina, of course :D) They have a wide variety, both fried and baked.
30573	60698	Get bartender Chris to make you a \
263441	61118	Best bandeja campesina evvveeer try it
4787	61118	This place has the food pre cooked and waiting on the counter in the kitchen. It will come out instantly. Not great.
40874	61118	The chicken quesadilla is my favorite. The pork chip is good too!  Don't forget the green sauce.
40642	61118	Portions here are HUGE.
4787	61118	The food is good here if it's crowded. If it's dead your food will come out instantly (read between the lines here). Service is good. Get the fried yuka and any grilled meat. Flan is nice too.
216629	61132	a salad i actually finished completely!
17034	61132	Come in and see the place.  New look, same good food!  And the girls are friendly and warm to talk to!

43577	61210	really amazing place!! I think it is a secret!
24468	61210	Needs even more locations!
82569	61274	Try the Duck Pate with Confit Gizzard- they brought it to Choice Eats last year and everyone loved it!
2448	61274	Cauliflower. Meatballs. Can't go wrong with any dish. And the service is excellent.
4697	61274	The bartenders are saucy, sassy and Southern.  This girl could not be more happy. Oh, it helps that that food and drinks are top notch as well. You can Spatzle me all day, boys.
118709	61285	5% off if u pay with cash
40642	61285	The Korean food here is pretty decent. Typical Korean food. Nice decor and atmosphere. Buta Kimchi Yumatei is nice and spicy.

22719	64680	Coconut Curry Chicken Salad at @freshandco is amazing! (c\/o @andreidinuionit)
38701	64714	The chicken Marsala is a must here. Always a lot, piled with mushrooms and sauce. So good!
18562	64823	The chocolate chip muffin here is cookie crunchy on the muffin top and resembles marbled cake on the inside, and bit candy bar-like chunks of real chocolate all over it. Like a muffin caricature.
49177	64882	The fountain sodas always taste a little syrupie
30546	64882	Grandma Slice - best slice in New York City. Period.
170055	64882	Sicilian is my favorite!!!!!

9527	64895	one of the best Pad Thai in town
220081	64971	Plan a little extra time for a visit; not the best staffed SBs.
202998	65011	Too crowded and really shitty Internet
36661	65095	There salads r the shit and I don't like salads!
66409	65095	Check out the back patio.
66409	65095	Haven't been there in years but it's such a welcome oasis in the middle of the city!
36661	65095	Everything is awesome except for the bread. Please change the bread. The free breadthat is...

79452	65144	Try spaghetti alla pirata without tomato source. It's much better.
25094	65144	Good cozy italian on LaGuardia. Pizza is better than other dishes but all in all pretty, pretty good. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

5183	65189	Get a side of Crack sauce with your Carne Asada Burrito.
42696	65189	100% worth the wait.  Pulled Pork burrito - can't go wrong.  Go for the crack sauce.
175941	66081	Try the ricotta and orange honey crostini. $2.50! Holy crap... yum.
80104	66081	The price is right, but the service is a bit passive-aggressive and it also pissed me off that they don't have a bread basket. Meatballs were phenominal.
13880	66081	Pasta here = #fail
57992	66081	Try the pannacotta with honey and rosemary. One of the best I've had in the city.
89566	66081	Paninos looked good. Meatballs were decent. No meatball shop meatballs, but pretty solid for brunch. Check in for a free Bellini! (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
12533	66081	incredible restaurant. freshest food. incredible atmosphere. fantastic service. leave totally fulfilled.
165067	66081	Susan is one of the best waitresses\/servers with fantastic attitude. She educated us all the way to a fantastic experience. I'm very pleased :)

204577	67049	Food is amazing, ask what soups they have today all will be delish!!
52962	67064	Garlic steak is to die for. Mushroom risotto is amazing too!
114319	67064	We prefer this location to the midtown one-remember that neither dessert,coffee ,nor wine are included in pre-fixe price. And we eat lightly for the week before and after coming here !

2720	68216	@Ryan S. Thanks 4 the tip. I am now carefully avoiding any semen or suspected semen or semen-like substance in the Starbucks loo. Not an easy thing to verify. But I also noticed suspicious fluid too.
9409	68216	I love the staff here.
38005	68311	Watch out for Luis...
38005	68311	Seriously. Look out for Luis.
82569	68453	Village Voice is excited to have Testaccio at the 2012 ChoiceEats food fest!  Full list of restaurants here: http:\/\/ow.ly\/8QjDQ
39371	68453	The dessert gelato wasn't any good. $8 for melted gelato, 4 strawberries and sugar isn't worth it. The rest of the food was great, sea scallops with crabmeat was delicious.
56867	68829	Awesome brunch spot and all you can drink champagne cocktails. Start off classy and leave a hot mess all before 2pm!
24873	68829	Try the cucumber happy hour cocktail...it's crisp, refreshing and OUT OF THIS WORLD.
208636	68829	Loved their south african wine from Seven Sisters, but they don't carry it anymore.  Too bad!  Food is excellent!
48682	68935	The employees are really sweet and friendly.
953	68935	Decent but lacks WiFi and character of other Thinks
7599	68935	My favorite: the Spanish Latte.
21881	68935	Two bucks flat for a cup of Joe! In and out!
43905	68935	Coffee is great, bagels are good, grilled cheese is totally forgettable.
27168	68935	No wifi. Kind of a bummer.
142669	68935	Try the spanish latte. Mainly a haven for students, writers, and readers. If you want wifi go to the campus location or starbucks. Its not a problem for the rest of us.
6	68983	Nice vibe in here. They give too much pasta, though.

4787	69575	If you're not a regular here, don't expect any special treatment. It's so-so at best to begin with so I recommend avoiding it.
4787	69575	Have never had a great experience here. Service is not good I unless you are a regular...
36206	69601	Way overpriced snacks and drinks! Seems like the guy at the counter makes up prices as he goes. Also, they charge a EXTRA DOLLAR for any food made after 10pm.
36661	69745	Stay away from Anthony (tony), monteiro!
60021	69745	Whoever said appleee's is better than Tops is obviously nt from around here...

253922	69745	Try the mimosas.
193062	69953	They boast a $16 pastrami sandwich, just as the name of the place suggests, a pretentious price, cus although the sandwich is hefty, it's a lil dry and I've tasted tastier pastrami honestly.

13128	70790	Get the burrito, skip the reg plate (this is NOT Chipotle). the tortilla is fresh and has cheese. Get the super hot salsa if you like hot. It's no joke.
16255	70790	when asked what type of beans, say \
82569	70790	Winner of Best Burrito in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Spring for the guac topping - it's the perfect addition to the perfect burrito.

13693	70790	From the clientele and the  food I feel like this is a secret portal to San Francisco.
24772	70790	Believe the hype about how hot the hot sauce is.  I-chihuahua, my mouth has been on fire for 15 mins after eating

91387	71070	Ask for the pecking duck early because it takes half an hour to make (it's not on the menu). Definitely worth it!!
36704	71070	Bad service, low class people, tons of bones in my duck wonton soup, adult couple at table next to me loudly making out. Yeah I won't be eating here again.
27075	71070	Most drinks, even top shelf, $4 during happy hour 4pm-8pm. And try the Shrimp dumplings

121273	71417	Excellent wine and beer (& cider) to accompany your meal.
148828	71486	Forget the fresh squeezed juices..Way too overpriced. Best deals are the fresh cut fruit bowls from the fridge by the door. They use fresh cut kiwi, mango, watermelon, papaya, pineapple and grapes!
32206	71579	Ask for the day's special!
26060	71641	This place is the best.
38074	71641	Best lunch deal in dt\/Tribecca 5.95 home made soups and salads. So fresh, so tasty!

90175	71971	The spicy crunchy tuna is amazing!!
44778	71971	Amazing sushi - in both quality and presentation. I think of Loop as a more affordable and more intimate Koi. Reco the spicy tuna on crispy rice to start.
38431	71971	Great spot to have lunch on a nice day. Great soundtrack, friendly staff, and enjoyable atmosphere!
170559	71971	The 3rd Avenue roll is fabulous.

8285	72593	Try the Cheeseburger with Lettuce, Tomato & Mayo - Awesome! (via @Foodspotting)
19408	72623	Surprisingly good chicken on a block with a lot of good chicken. Much better than Big Arc chicken, and maybe not as great as BaoBQ, but that's apples and oranges.
19408	72623	Amazing, juicy and tender chicken, great place for take-out and way better than that Big Arc chicken next door. Such bitter competition. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
86519	72714	Sticking fingers in cups, outrageous lines, ghetto staff...this is by far the WORST Starbucks I have EVER been to...avoid if you can. You will thank me...
17734	72714	Welcome to the slowest Sbux in Manhattan!
33575	72945	black n white shake is the move!
102	73222	I like the food and drinks, but they play their music on some sort of odd, reverby EQ setting that is very distracting
58	73254	Did you order the bone marrow? If you didn't then you are simply doing it wrong. Flag down your server and correct your mistake.
29831	73254	The only place to consider eating late night.
124588	73254	Had a great day and an even better night!!!! No worries & no headaches!!!! With great company. Werq

16602	73254	Order the bone marrow & fried chicken and go home happy.
184814	73304	Love the simple, straight forward atmosphere. Cody's is owned and operated by a former cop. He's a great guy.
2228	73304	Pick a sixpoint on draft, baby
82569	73405	The chicken pot pie sports a fluffy puff-pastry top, and rich, creamy chicken stew underneath. If you loved Swanson chicken pot pies when you were a kid you'll adore the luxuriance of this rendition.
196154	73405	I miss having a place like this in the neighborhood!  For all of you health nuts, pay a visit ASAP!
180959	73405	Found a hair in the dish and server was didn't care. Awful service.

42214	73888	Try the meatloaf sandwich!
14448	74191	It have doughnuts in the name but I like their egg and cheese sandwiches best.
2374	74294	There is absolutely NO justification for the prices they charge. Pizza isn't worth half. Go anywhere else. Seriously.
166272	74294	Calzone heaven Spinach and cheese at less then 350 calories YUM YUM YUM
144261	74407	Not impressed...
224242	74450	Very nice servers
15492	74668	Service sucks, waited 15 mins for a drink at an empty bar while the barmaid counted her tips. Oh and the whole restaurant stunk like frumunda cheese. Gross!
70839	74668	WORST service ever!
29099	74668	The big Jack daddy Burger is the ultimate best!!!
616	74896	Whatever you do, get the baked ricotta.  Pizza is great. Mussels good too. We estimated $50k worth of whiskey on wall - whatchoo think?
616	74896	Whatever pizza you order, throw a fried egg on it. Amazing.
72	74896	whatever you do, drop an egg on your pizza. delicious. if you're not sure which one, perhaps get a pepperoni with egg on top

8146	74896	I'm hooked. Trippa finta alla' amatriciana one of the best egg dishes ever created. On breakfast and brunch menu.
24772	74896	Stick with the pizza and baked pastas.  Don't order the green salad, it's $11 for a few lettuce leaves and 1\/4 of a tomato.
4356	74896	Use the pepper oil (ask for it or it's already on the table) with your crust - delicious.
27367	74896	Try the Margherita - With egg & pancetta. Oozy yolk over everything. Fantastic. Like breakfast bacon & eggs with tomatoe sauce & toast(pizza dough)  (via @Foodspotting)
27367	74896	Try the House Gnocchi With Wild Boar Ragu - The boar was melt I yur mouth good. Gnocchi is almost never a bad thing.  (via @Foodspotting)
27367	74896	Try the Mozarella Burrata - Creamy cheese oozing. The tomatoes burst as u cut or bite them. Crunchy bread w the right amount of garlic rubbed on it.  (via @Foodspotting)
188400	74896	Order the meatball pizza (it's not on the menu).
26202	74896	Pizza's solid but make sure you start with the prosciutto. Enough for 2-3 people as a starter.
159682	74896	Craving a spicy pizza? This is the spot! \
178067	74896	I'm a model, you know what I mean and I do my little turn on the catwalk. On the catwalk, on the catwalk , yeah, I shake my little tush on the catwalk.

13693	75007	great spot to relax
54561	75022	The worst service ever. After waiting for my drink for 20 mins, I got a reply, \
71312	75029	Best Starbucks. No wait. Great baristas. Never mess up my drink.
13999	75029	Pay with your mobile app and leave your wallet at home!
34386	75029	The friendliest servers in the city
197679	75051	Franchise disguised as a local shop.  They're all the same.  Only a good place to eat if the weather is bad.  Pricey and rather greasy.
33575	75206	I have a bad feeling about this...
47663	75282	Very loud here I think due to the high ceilings. The sound just bounces around and echos. Don't come here to get any work done or bring noise cancelling headphones.
26202	75338	The don't take American Express, unfortunate.
28925	75371	Best frozen yogurt spot in NYC hands down. Pinkberry is so overrated.
140970	75371	At Phileo (formerly YogurtLand) you can choose from different flavored fro yo & add as many toppings as you want. Also they charge you by weight, not by size.
235080	75509	Out of state, of age, and only 1 form of ID? Have fun sippin on that soda...
72	75701	don't be a girl: order up a double (guinness mustard on top). and a drink on the side. and fries on the other side. what? you had a long day.
6120	75701	Order one more slider than you think you can actually eat. Thank me later.
429	75701	Guinness honey mustard. Ask for it.
89566	75701	Sweet little sliders and milkshakes. Get the Guinness shake and douse the sliders in chipotle ketchup. Chili cheese fries complete the meal. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
96349	75835	Coffeholic yayyy great place :)
87874	75835	It's true the line from 8:30-9a  can be long but they tend to overstaff then and are really good about getting everyone through fast.
217167	75955	Great variety of sandwiches! I got the Tuscan and it was great, huge hero.. I saved the other half for later and it was still good!!
227401	75985	Nj restaurant week pre fixe menu sept 18th -25th

33575	76581	Yummo Panko breadcrumbs under the crust!!!!
8051	76581	AVOID if possible. This pizza spot is overpriced and underwhelming, persisting by drunk patrons alone.
25807	76770	Longest line in the world filled with college students. Basically it's the daytime version of Williamsburg or the LES - just substitute alcohol for caffeine.
29320	76770	Not really that great if you don't have an NYU meal plan to spend, but it's so close to campus it's hard to turn down for convince sake.
197679	76770	Closed on Saturdays and Sundays in the summer.
216811	76770	probably the rudest workers you'll encounter. The prices seem to vary by day
125639	76770	Try the Very Berry Coffee Cake - Pretty good... But it's Starbucks :\/ (via @Foodspotting)
217394	76770	All Xmas latte flavors (caramel brûlée, gingerbread, pumpkin spice) are sooooo good!!!
129	76770	This tip was brought to you by the electrical outlet here that works.
68295	76770	They have holiday pastries now!
195788	76770	Big a big smile you always have better service :D
226566	76770	It's run by NYU so no Starbucks card purchases or free wifi (you have to be an NYU student.)
40642	76770	There is no FREE wi-fi here. What's up with that?
33463	76901	Strawberry Surf Rider all the way!
33463	76901	There's a 'Secret Menu' with awesome drinks like 'Pink Starburst' and 'Chocolate Covered Strawberry'. They're both awesome!

193062	77086	Got some Sufganiyot here for my boss, looked so good couldn't pass them up, a little pricey but were a huge hit at work, yummy as can be of course too.
193062	77086	they make a mean hot apple cider during the winter, hits the spot
22829	77199	The frozen yogurt is pretty good.
9253	77986	Portions are enormous so order well
17435	77986	get the dough flakes with chicken broth. do not bother with the seafood soup. overall, this place gets a C in my book.
18406	78005	I left this place, they served me rotten meat, grotesque!!!
14842	78005	Two.words. Crackling chicken.
28925	78067	Babaganoush is babababangin here. The owner was really nice too.

9253	78067	No coffee here :-(
42214	78081	Try the fettuccine with salmon. It's delicious. Their service is very friendly and amazingly fast.
103216	78081	Been searching for olive tapenade for a long time. Finally I found they serve it here with your bread in a tomato paste. A wonderful pairing up. Great with a dry white wine.
26168	78297	Some of the employees are amazing. Some.
16028	78422	The pumpkin pancakes are DELICIOUS!
50730	78624	$1 pizza.  Perfect drunk food.

38272	78902	Be very careful with raw seafood (crab, oyster) sometimes they're not fresh.
231094	79077	Best Pizza in 5 Boroughs hands down! The only people that disagree are the cheapskates!
121273	79077	Exceptional thin crust pizza!
153770	79077	Worth the trip!

2442	79541	if you are looking for a starbucks for their bathrooms, don't go to this one. not sure how or why, but they actually do not have bathrooms for customers.
116122	79862	Donuts are made on site and are often more fresh than at other Dunkin Donuts in the neighborhood.  The morning crew on the weekend is extremely friendly and will remember your order.
116122	79862	If you get the veggie flatbread, ask for it extra toasted - when they send it through the toaster just once it isn't quite enough.
111137	79880	Worst service. I am wondering why they are wearing Starbucks uniform.
226771	79908	Happy hour! Shrimp corndog and lobster slider!

72170	79919	Breakfast wraps are pretty tasty and filling and only $3.26 (incl. tax) right now. Thai Chicken Wrap & Ostrich burger are also satisfying. Smoothies = not worth the calories\/points.
23621	79919	If you like waiting a long time for your food, Energy Kitchen is the place to be.
49206	79919	Sit at one of the couches and you can steal the starbucks wifi. It's awesome.

66227	79919	Bison egg wrap is pretty good. Just needs some hot sauce.

24915	80406	mini cucumber cream cheese sandwich is a great snack

25152	80645	They chill their Gamay!!!!!!!!!
44739	80645	Sunday Supper special. You'll leave stuffed!

953	80645	Unimpressed with the chicken-egg sandwich.
18993	80769	Warm blueberry muffins are clutch.
49343	80769	Steak sandwich - baguette was nice and fresh, steak was a little dry.  Fries were cold.
34476	80844	TERRIBLE FOOD. You might get lucky and get a hair in your pizza.
183355	80844	Keep walking! DON'T STOP. Eff this place. And check my tips - I'm never this upset to give negative review. Bunch of lazy ass, rude, crooks!
82569	80866	This Choice Eats attendee in 2010 brought Tocino (sugar-achuete cured pork) sliders in purple yam rolls with grated green mango and Chicken\/Pork adobo skewers.
47769	80866	Not a place you want to go if you want authentic Filipino cuisine
27682	81096	Where are the burritos?
82569	81254	Anything with poached eggs is mind-blowingly delicious at this cafe!
1509	81254	Holy smokes the baked goods are nom-nom-nom delicious. Not to be missed.
13880	81254	Sit at the bar on the far left, watch the room. For breakfast I recommend the eggs in spicy tomato sauce. It will wake you right up.
5347	81254	Impacable food, impecable service. Have to come back to try suckling pig.
5183	81254	The pork with crackling is in the top 3 \
23793	81254	Get everything! Seating at the bar if the resto is full, make sure to put your name in though to be added to the roster. Very accommodating and delicious food!
196154	81254	The Roman Trattoria of the moment.  Danny Meyer never ceases to amaze with stellar food and the best service standard in New York City.  Peppered chicken on Arugula. So simple, so good.
24873	81254	Try the Americitriana - Amazing! Spicy eggs and tomato sauce (via @Foodspotting)

38701	81284	The presentation of the oysters and sashimi sampler are unreal! Check them out.

6741	81357	The seafood soup. Seriously.
68409	81383	It's all about the 7 oz. burgers.  Get a classic combo or go crazy w\/ the toppings.  Waffle fries & shakes hit the spot too!  Open until 1:30 am on the weekends! - MichelleC.tv
21380	81579	OVERPRICED, last time i bought real food, made me sick
82569	81616	Try the classic bistro salad frisée aux lardons. Break the egg so that the lemon yellow yolk flows out, and mix it all together into a smoky, sticky mess. It's probably the best salad of the year.
72	81616	go really hungry and get the pork ribs (so salty!), fried cauliflower (whoa! i am a fan of cauliflower once again) and the corn (to balance the two sides). you'll probably take some of it home
82569	81616	The Village Voice voted this Best Tripe in our Best Of New York Poll!
2839	81616	Ribs were excellent, but portions small for \
72	81616	to drink, the lady should order up a seven spice sour and the gentleman, bull in the heather (you can't go wrong with the mix of glenrothes, absinthe and honey)

28925	81990	Pad see ew with a Korean twist: Galbi and Mango Kimchi! What! So good!
38456	81990	Very bad service. At one point, the ENTIRE crew just sat to eat together!! We had to work hard to get their attention for some service, and when the waitress came, she treated us as we disturbed her.
147510	82051	atmosphere is off the hook!!
47830	82254	Egg white english muffin and tuna salad with a wheat bagel is good for gym rats looking to get a protein fix.

68370	82441	Paul, the store manager, is awesome!
17238	82634	Lamb is my fav.which is a hit or miss sometimes. Tender or tough... Go in and sit the service is decent and they have a flat screen with the latest bollywood music hits.  The portions are big too.
17238	82634	Best Indian in the neighborhood or the only one.
257034	82660	Finish everything or get yelled at (speaking from experience)
68595	82660	Decent quality... They yell at you if you don't finish everything. And if they think you are initially over ordering they use their own judgement on what to actually bring you ! -_-
20178	83038	Don't expect the employees to talk to you. If I worked here I'd hate my life too.
26197	83182	Pepperoni and hot pepper pizza is the best!
26197	83182	The pepperoni and hot pepper combo is awesome!

49805	84910	Come with a small group of friends and order the Omakase - a complete sampler of all their tapas, cookies, and ice creams for only $50!
11466	84910	They should be playing A.N.Jell in the background. Or the equivalent crooning Asian boy band.
2621	84910	They are changing their menu this week.  I hope the coconut crema is still around afterwards!
5503	84972	Split the fries. You won't finish them unless... You're a giant or dinasour

133092	95645	The best vegetarian item is the energy wrap, sans the turkey!
132803	95645	The goat cheese omelette is really good, as well as the spicy chicken wrap. They just renovated and it seems to be under new management. It's taking some getting used to. Like waitress service? Weird.
11315	95744	Really small restaurant. If you go there during the lunch rush, the food is delicious, but they're kinda anxious to move butts in and out of there as fast as they can.

116122	96914	Disappointing experience. Was it that hard to not put onions on my disappointing burger?

7487	129237	Their .99 cent pizza is not worth .99 cents... I do not recommend it, too thin, barely any cheese and it upset my stomach. I recommend Maoz next door.

48197	144373	Ask for a recommendation - the best dishes aren't on the menu!
24230	144561	Sushi served on a conveyor belt. Best time to go is Wednesday if you enjoy salmon.
43081	144561	Throw your plates away. They're disposable.
30998	144561	If you're not sitting in front of the conveyor belt at a kaiten-zushi (conveyor-belt sushi) restaurant, something is terribly, terribly wrong.

31943	146020	It's ALL about the Danish cheese. That is all. ?
9566	146357	The Coconut mini baklava is to die... but you have to be stern when you are ordering. The staff isn't really the nicest but after a while they get to know you.
429	147002	The Porterhouse
20401	147002	One of the best steakhouses in NYC!

69788	151325	Best bar in the neighborhood!
243427	151325	Great wings
43734	151325	Isa & Adrianna are da bomb.  Best waitresses in the city.
43734	151325	Apparently not all Atomic Wings are created equal. Midtown 1140 Second Av is HORRIBLE. Nothing at all like the fantastic Blue Room.
43734	151325	...and don't forget the combo waffle fries and onion rings. You would be hard pressed to find any better.
43734	151325	Best damn wings...anywhere!
196173	151376	Really nice comfortable atmosphere, gotta try the mixed drinks!
12314	151381	Ask for Carlo, great service!

98972	152402	Try the Fresh Home-Made Mushroom Ravioli & savour the moment with a Sangria.
8051	152402	It's OK to ask for more Parmesan cheese.  Drink the Sangria.
72	153035	for some reason, i always get the chicken and gyro combo platter. it's like breakfast, lunch and snacktime all in one and you cannot resist
254822	154789	Def go on live music nights and ask for John's section- he's the best!  Have the black eyed pea soup and save room for the bread pudding!
29301	155079	Daft punk goes surprisingly well with tacos and sangria. Definitely try the pomegranate skirt steak tacos!!
193062	155079	Got the mahi mahi tacos, pretty decent but pretty small, not truly worth the 10 bucks.
102715	155221	Weird... The service I got was pretty nice, and they served me with a smile. Can't understand from where the complaints come from...

131875	156396	It's heavy and juicy ! But still yummy
14203	156396	I recommend a cheeseburger with raw onions. You can skip the fries; they're nothing to write home about.
150051	156402	The tomato soup is really good, but I would only order a small, or it becomes too much. Getting your sandwich toasted might take an extra 10 minutes, but it's better that way.
173942	156910	Ask for the Chef's table
24873	156910	Try the Apple crumble a la mode - Third course...nom nom nom (via @Foodspotting)

24873	156910	Try the Artisnal Pasta - First course nom  (via @Foodspotting)

36202	158746	Hot sandwiches are decent but overpriced. Generally overpriced, bad quality food
9566	158958	The french toast bagel and hazelnut cream cheese is better than anything
15247	159042	One of the best tasting menus in NYC. Or, well, anywhere. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
49766	159042	s'mores are legendary!  Salt Cod fritters are also a must
63386	159042	Adorable and quaint! Get the hamachi app and lobster risotto or scallops!
15416	159042	I recommend the Salt Cod Fritters, Chilled Corn Soup, Lobster Risotto, and don't leave without the Smores!

188400	160446	Sit under the heat vents to stay warm when it's cold out.
4787	161178	Cuban Chinese food. Find a better place and I'll be there. Good food, good service, not cheap. Mixed drinks are surprisingly awesome.

4787	166526	Beer good. Food bad. Service worse. Maybe the worst Bloody Mary I've ever had. Told us halfway through brunch that the credit card machine was down. Won't be back. Go to Sanford's for brunch instead.

82569	170256	Birdbath Bakery's chocolate chip cookie perfectly straddles the crispy-chewy divide, and packs enough butter and chocolate to incapacitate an elephant
225770	170256	Farcical service. Watch as everything falls apart
104	170256	Their chocolate chocolate chunk cookie is so good I almost gobbled it up before I had a chance to write this tip. Like chocolate? Get one.

71476	170319	Shell steak is great if your afraid to try something -- grab a thai iced tea too

48083	170700	Still like food @ Room Service in Chelsea a bit better, but this place is damn good & gets a few more points for ambience over R.S.  Quality of food for price is hard to beat!
24511	170700	Get the Tom Yum soup. It is properly spicy. Get the Larb too, though it is NOT properly spicy. Thai iced tea is a ripoff in those skinnyass glasses.

38456	175522	Lousy service and unfriendly staff. Double espresso was dull. Grilled cheese focaccia was decent.
31304	175522	Coffee is avg. but egg sandwiches are solid and they also have smoothies. Seating inside is nice and usually not crowded. Not a place with 20 phonies on macs.

82569	181971	Skip the more elaborate stuff at Okeanos, and stick to the simple, Greek dishes, foremost among them the whole grilled fish. The sardines are a great choice, but so is the pearly-fleshed striped bass.

15416	183876	Fish Tacos!
57056	183876	Avoid the mojitos. And they don't take AMEX.
29831	183876	Everyone raves about the fish tacos, but don't undervalue the nachos
74287	183876	Happy hour menu from 4-7 everyday is a steal in NYC.
181660	183876	Nice interior, but no non- dairy options. They only have white wraps and white rice :(

80104	186707	The burger is divine - make sure to get it cooked med-rare. The fact that potato chips are served as an accompaniment - and not fries - is a major buzzkill.

220130	189445	Skip the lines (and the bad service, from what I'm told) at the Brooklyn location and come out to Douglaston. Chat up John if he's your waiter--a youngish brown-haired guy who's quite friendly.

13019	1537683	The edamame here is served COLD and it's prepared with Star Anise (licorice taste)...so be forewarned. It's not the typical hot and salty kind. And it is VERY good.

4787	2133943	Wish I could tell you how the food is here. They said it was over an hour wait for a table when the place was half full. If that's how they manage the front I'd hate to know how they manage the back.
4787	2133943	They don't like kids in this place. More than half the tables were empty and they told us that it was an hour wait once they saw our carriage. Shady. One girl told us not to eat here, said it was bad.
